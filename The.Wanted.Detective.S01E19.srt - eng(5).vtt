00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.600
had never been so clean before.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.480
You didn't even

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.210
break a sweat that whole month.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240
And that one time—

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.390
during the Spring Festival,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.050
we were all making dumplings,

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.360
and you insisted on
adding surprises inside.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.320
You filled one with spices

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.790
and said

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.550
whoever ate it

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.270
would have great luck in the coming year.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:57.960
And then…

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.360
My dad ate it.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.330
Master usually ate plain food,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.320
and that one bite

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.870
made his face swell for days.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.270
He didn't even dare show up
at morning court.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:06.840
He said…

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.670
he said he was afraid
people would laugh

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.080
that the great King of Constables

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.910
had actually been poisoned.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.740
L-Like you're one to talk.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.390
You caused plenty of trouble too.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.360
I still remember

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.030
when Chief Fang thought

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.030
you were too young

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.560

bring me here?

I've had sleepwalking issues
since I was little.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:31.750

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.550

I'm very strong,

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.150

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.510
Please don't kick me out.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.150
I swear

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.870
I took the meds tonight.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.960
How could I still be sleepwalking?

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.000
That was not possible.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.080
You have to believe me.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.080
I can't leave.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.960
I really want to stay.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960
Alright, enough!

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.860
Just go back to bed, okay?

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.390
Do you know

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.450
where your room is?

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:53.120
I do.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.250
Then hurry up and go.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.000
Get back to your room and sleep.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.840
Will this plan work?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.069
We won't know unless we try.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.960
I think it will.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.000
You look so delicate,

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.440
yet you're brave enough
to catch toads with me.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.160
Aren't you scared?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.310
Of course I am.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.000
But I'm more worried about him.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.000
Hurry up.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.550
Let's go.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.350
What's going on?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.080
The dogs won't stop barking.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.920
Get everyone over here.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.120
Search the East Courtyard thoroughly.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.790
Your plan worked.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.610
Let's go to the West Courtyard.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.070
Madman?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.060
Brute?

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:35.920
Why are you here?

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.880
I was worried about you.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.880
We agreed you'd send word out

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.720
after you got in.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.350
Why didn't you?

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.830
Can I count on you or not?

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:41.350
Look,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.030
I wanted to send word out,

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.110
but they were watching me

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.350
way too closely.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.610
They even watched me while I ate.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:47.110
They also put

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.720
sedatives in our food.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.240
I had to pretend I didn't know

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240
and eat it anyway.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.960
Once they lowered their guard,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.110
I came out to investigate this courtyard.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:57.070
Did you find anything suspicious?

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.910
A lot of things seem suspicious.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.240
They care a lot

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.270
about physical strength.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.400
Anyone who's strong

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.510
gets picked immediately.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.830
The literary test is just for show.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:05.720
You could recite classics wrong

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.240
and still get in.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.200
And since we got here,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.640
they've fed us well.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.160
All those blood-nourishing tonics

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.590
have been provided to us.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.440
Most importantly,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.400
they don't allow us

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.350
to move freely around this courtyard.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.350
So this "adopting sons" thing

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.640
is just a trap.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.680
Told you—

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.790
they're after guys like me,

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.200
strong and built.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:23.880
Whether you're filial or not

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.140
doesn't matter at all.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.350
Listen.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.550
There's a hidden room

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.240
at the back of the courtyard.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.790
I smelled

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.310
a strong scent of blood there.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.110
I suspect

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.480
that's where they use people

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.810
for their experiments.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.310
The layout of this place

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.510
is incredibly complicated,

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.750
and the guards

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.830
are extremely vigilant.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.750
There's definitely
something shady going on here.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.160
But we can't alert them too soon.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.510
You go back first.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.590
Tomorrow morning, bring people

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:51.440
from the Weizhou Garrison

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.790
and surround the Salt Business Guild

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.920
to catch them red-handed.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.450
Alright.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.640
Wait.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.790
The dogs have stopped barking.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:19:59.480
I need to go.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.440
Miss Huo is still waiting outside.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.480
Miss Huo?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.830
How could you let a defenseless girl

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.070
wait for you out there?

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.510
She's been worried sick about you.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.550
I couldn't reassure her.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.880
And she's not some defenseless girl.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.310
Without her,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.890
I wouldn't have gotten in here.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:12.440
But...

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
No buts.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.720
Don't be such a wimp.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:15.790
Take care of yourself.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:16.550
I'm leaving.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.960
Promise me—

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.080
take good care of her.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.790
I will.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.440
I'll come pick you up tomorrow morning.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.900
Then you two can be lovey-dovey
all you want.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.640
How's Coroner Feng?

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.970
Don't worry. He's fine.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.000
Madman found a lead.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:50.570
We need to get help
from the Weizhou Garrison.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.370
Let's go.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.790
By the way,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.640
he mentioned you just now.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:57.680
He mentioned me?

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.830
What did he say?

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.000
Take a guess.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.470
What do you think he said?

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.930
Are you scared?

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.750
Scared of dying,

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.550
or scared of dying before catching him?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.480
Both.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.770
I'm afraid they won't be able
to handle my death.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.350
Especially Xueman.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:35.480
Birth, aging, sickness, and death

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.880
are part of life,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.440
and fear is only human.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.230
Do you remember

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.710
the first time
we went out on a case together?

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.510
That serial murder case.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.680
The killer caught me off guard

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.350
and charged straight
at your chest with a knife.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.370
At that moment,

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.350
you were trembling with fear,

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.070
frozen in place.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.960
You rushed to my side

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.000
and used your arm to block the knife.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.400
You didn't budge an inch.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.240
Covered in blood, you glared at him.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.240
That outlaw was scared out of his wits.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.640
In that brief moment,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.730
we took him down together.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.880
You blamed yourself so much afterward.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.070
Do you remember

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.640
what I said to you then?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.000
You said,

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.970
"No matter how evil a criminal is,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.060
as long as you don't fear them,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.570
they will fear you."

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.440
That's right.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.400
No matter how deep the darkness,

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.510
as long as you have the courage
to open your eyes

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.640
and face it head-on,

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.110
wherever your gaze falls,

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.590
there will be light.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.030
Don't fear

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:42.490
what hasn't happened yet.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.000
Before the knife pierces you,

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.750
you still have work to do.

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:48.510
And don't forget—

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.750
you're not the only one

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.350
facing that knife.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.200
Stop overthinking.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.590
There's still so much

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.030
waiting for you to do.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.790
[Salt Business Guild]

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.550
Catch.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.530
[Salt Business Guild]

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.400
Beiming.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.020
What are you doing?

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.960
I want to go
to the Salt Business Guild too.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.070
Didn't we agree?

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.920
We're already on it.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.880
I can't just leave everything

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.750
to you guys

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:58.640
and lie here in bed

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.590
doing nothing.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.890
That'd be like waiting for death.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:12.110
[Salt Business Guild]

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.740
Mr. Wang?

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:23.880
Mr. Wang,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.360
forgive me for not welcoming you properly.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.110
Mr. Wang,

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.160
you've brought so many people

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
to my guild today.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.350
What's this for?

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.790
We received a report
that the Salt Business Guild

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:35.860
is using the guise

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.550
[Salt Business Guild]

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:38.270
of adopting sons for rich merchants

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.370
to recruit young men,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:42.920
only to secretly harm them

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.030
for your unspeakable purposes.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.830
That's untrue.

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.130
It's a terrible misunderstanding,

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:48.740
Mr. Wang.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.920
The guild merely acts

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.750
as a middleman

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.000
between both parties.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.110
It's a charitable act for the public good.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:56.040
There's nothing

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.750
underhanded going on here.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.950
We'll find out once we search the place.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.920
Fine.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.920
Then please,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.030
go in and look around.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.160
After a thorough inspection,

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.350
the name of the Salt Business Guild

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.680
can be cleared.

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:17.640
Open the door!

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:19.200
[Salt Business Guild]

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.790
Officers, please.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.480
Don't miss any corner.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.510
Yes!

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.160
Hurry.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.660
Hurry up.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.110
I'll say it again—

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.270
open the lock.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.160
Mr. Wang, I really can't.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.790
There's nothing worth seeing in there.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:05.640
Just a filthy mess.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.480
You may be disgusted.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.140
Officer!

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.720
Officers! Officers!

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.240
You can't go in.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:41.050
There's blood on the floor.
Quite a lot of it.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.440
What's going on?

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.930
Why is there blood on the floor?

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.030
I... I...

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.240
I can explain.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.290
This place

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.440
used to be the guild's kitchen.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.160
We've got

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.590
a lot of people to support

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.270
and a lot of mouths to feed.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.680
So we used to kill livestock here

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.960
every day.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.030
Over time,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:02.040
the smell of blood built up.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.270
Later,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.750
an expert said

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.550
the resentment here was too strong.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.070
Well? Is it human blood?

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.350
Human blood and animal blood

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.160
are difficult to distinguish once dried.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.830
This man stays calm

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:14.240
as we raid the place.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.770
He must have been prepared.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.240
Oh, no.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:19.390
Coroner Feng might be in danger.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.770
Where are those adopted sons?

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.510
All well fed and taken care of.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.240
Where are they? Take us to them.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.240
Well...

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:27.970
Lead the way!

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.880
Okay, okay.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.160
This way, Officers.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.530
Why have we been summoned here?

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.340
What kind of test is this?

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.320
Don't tell me there's another test.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.510
Just roll with the punches.

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.830
Does this mean we passed?

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.160
Alright, quiet down.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.880
Officers,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.510
all the adopted sons are here.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.640
If you don't believe me,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.110
you can ask them yourselves.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.070
Aren't you all

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.110
eating well, drinking well,

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.070
and sleeping well here?

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.110
Yeah, yeah.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.350
Yeah.

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.640
They say I plan to take your lives.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.740
That makes no sense at all.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.000
Exactly! We've been treated well

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.270
with good food and drinks.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.350
Every meal is nourishing,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.400
like nothing we've ever had before.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.510
That's right.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:13.920
We wear silk and sleep under satin.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.230
Even the beds are soft and cozy.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.270
Hold on. Someone's missing.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.920
A friend of mine

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.350
passed the test yesterday.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.240
I saw him come in with my own eyes.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.640
Now he's gone.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.590
Where have you hidden him?

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.400
-He's gone?
-He's gone?

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:28.350
Guess he left.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.250
Come to think of it,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.750
the fat guy next door to me

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.360
is missing too.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.640
Yeah, it seems that fat guy is missing.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.280
Officer, may I ask

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.110
what your friend's name is?

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.240
His name is Feng Qingzhuo. Where is he?

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.200
Mr. Feng?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.400
You've got the wrong idea.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.350
He changed his mind and left.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.160
He left?

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.880
You're lying.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.400
I saw him just last night.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.510
I'm not lying.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.680
He left just before you all arrived.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.000
Besides, he's got two good legs.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:09.400
If he wanted to leave,
I couldn't stop him.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.960
Move aside.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.160
Search every corner.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.070
Beiming, why are you here?

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.750
Where's Coroner Feng?

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.400
Yes.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.510
Mr. Wang,

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.960
how dare I lie to you?

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.160
You've searched everywhere.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.350
Is Madman in danger?

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:37.830
Even if they were to harm him,

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.350
they wouldn't do it here.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.750
Before men from the Weizhou Garrison came,

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:42.630
Tong Shuang was at the back gate,

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.510
and I was at the front.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.160
Neither of us saw Coroner Feng leave.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.310
After they arrived,

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.400
all doors were watched.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.060
There's no way anyone got out.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:50.160
Mr. Wang,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.510
we're just

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.350
honest businessmen.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.860
We'd never earn dirty money like that.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.690
Tong Shuang,

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:04.010
before the soldiers arrived,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.720
did you see

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.680
a firewood cart?

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.090
A firewood cart?

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:13.280
Yes.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.030
But since it was

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.350
just carrying firewood,

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:21.750
I didn't think much of it.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.790
Logically, a firewood cart

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.680
should be coming
into the guild from outside.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.440
Why would there be

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.750
a fully loaded firewood cart

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.030
leaving the guild?

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.410
Coroner Feng was on that cart?

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.400
Xueman,

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.310
special times

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.040
call for special measures.

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.160
What a coincidence.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.240
Sleepwalking again?

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.750
Can we trust the guild director?

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.750
He admitted Coroner Feng

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:13.940
was put in the firewood cart,

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.550
but it wasn't them

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.750
who loaded it.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.510
He only knows
the general direction it went.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.960
The Yellow Heaven is always cautious.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.440
Every step is independent.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.720
He was probably not lying.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.510
Coroner Feng was alive

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.440
when he was taken.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.560
We still have time.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:42.570
What's going on?

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.400
Why are we tied up?

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.550
We're not far

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.260
from death now.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.880
Why is your hand bleeding?

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.130
I'm bleeding myself

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.480
to leave a trail.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.200
It might save our lives.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.080
What on earth is happening?

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.870
You wanna live?

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:04.960
Yes.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.880
Right now,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.480
you and I are in the same boat.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.790
If I die,

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.790
you definitely won't survive.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:11.980
If I survive,

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.670
I swear I'll get you out.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.180
The Yellow Heaven wants to use our blood

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:17.110
to make pills.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.720
If we catch them,

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.160
we'll be doing the world a favor.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.730
Right now,

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:22.750
I'm leaving a blood trail

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.230
so my friends can find us.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.000
Don't say anything.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.260
Stay quiet.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.750
Okay.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.510
Okay, okay.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.920
Beiming, there are so many paths.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.000
How are we supposed to find him?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.880
Let's split up.

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.200
I don't know how far we have to go.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.420
If I run out of blood later,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.200
I'll use yours.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.000
I... I...

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.980
Cut the crap. Shut up.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:08.320
If I don't bleed you now,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.480
they'll bleed you later,

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.880
and you won't survive it.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.110
Fine, fine.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.650
There's blood here!

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.980
Where?

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:23.150
Here.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:33.820
Feng Qingzhuo left us a mark.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.409
Is he going to be okay?

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.800
We need to hurry. He won't last long.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.800
Get up. Get up.

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.840
Move.

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:49.920
Don't you usually just bring blood?

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.000
Why did you bring two people today?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.030
They got out of line

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.230
and almost ruined everything.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:54.400
Why is this one injured?

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.360
He's bleeding a lot.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.320
He got cut just now.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.920
Such a waste of blood!

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.510
Alright, alright.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:00.710
Drag them inside now.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.240
Let's go.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.320
He's passed out.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.960
Move.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.980
Don't fall asleep.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.030
Don't fall asleep.

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:36.110
Sir,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.290
what are you going to do?

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.480
You've already lost so much blood.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.550
Might as well drain it all.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.010
Come on.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:43.850
Don't struggle.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.110
The more you struggle,

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.030
the more it hurts.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.030
Once your blood

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.670
is completely drained,

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.670
the pain will stop.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.760
Sir,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.550
is this dagger clean?

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:56.320
I'm a coroner.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.480
Let me tell you,

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:58.760
if the dagger isn't clean,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.290
my blood will easily spoil,

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.320
and once it spoils,

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.650
you won't be able to
make any pills with it.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.590
Better now?

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.550
My clothes are so dirty.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.670
This dagger

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.770
needs to be soaked in boiling water

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.380
or heated over a fire.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:20.920
Why are you so picky?

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.070
Say one more word,

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:23.590
and I'll stab you dead.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.840
No, no.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.000
Do you know

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.760
why your boss told you

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.880
to bleed me

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.030
instead of killing me?

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.710
Because blood from the living is clean,

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:33.120
and blood from the dead is dirty.

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.920
The blood of the living

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.050
is not the same as the blood of the dead.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:36.920
Shut up!

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.800
I can't shut up.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.960
I have to tell you—

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.070
blood from the dead

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.230
carries countless illnesses

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.440
that will get into the pills.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.190
The pills will become poisonous.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.230
That's not good.

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.800
Those are filthy things.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.550
Whoever takes the pills will be poisoned.

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.710
All your efforts will be wasted.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:50.670
Poisoned!

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.860
With so much blood lost,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.030
will Madman die?

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.100
He must still be alive.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.740
Madman, hang in there.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.840
As long as you don't die,

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.320
I swear I'll stop calling you Madman.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.920
I can even call you Papa Feng!

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.400
Beiming,

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.180
can you hold on?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.440
Do you have a family?

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.630
Why did you work for the Yellow Heaven?

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.510
Do you know you've been brainwashed?

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.710
The Yellow Heaven has been lying.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:27.730
I'm a coroner.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.920
There's no such thing

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.190
as an immortality pill.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:33.480
Let me tell you...

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.880
Didn't I tell you to shut up?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.930
Shut up!

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.070
Holy Master.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.030
It's all lies.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.960
He's got a black mole

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.000
on the right side of his eye.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.190
He has a black mole.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.710
So you're

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:13.550
the Holy Master of the Yellow Heaven?

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.630
You can still talk?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.840
I'm Huang Wuchang.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.440
Thank you for your contribution

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.840
to the Yellow Heaven.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:23.870
After we ascend to immortality,

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.280
we'll make sure your next life

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.840
is full of wealth and glory.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.670
You'll help me ascend?

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.070
You've done so many evil things.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.840
You'll pay the price.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.920
You are

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.850
a very interesting offering,

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:42.110
different

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.590
from the others.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.800
Is the altar ready?

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:49.320
Yes.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.440
It's right ahead.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.730
The blood trail's gone.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.000
These barrels

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.590
were used to hold blood and corpse oil.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.550
He must be nearby.
