00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.400
Little White Dragon?

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.130
What are you doing here?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.530
We've got a new assignment.

[Episode 13]

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.000
Am I going blind?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.360
Don't worry.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.880
Once I apply these eye drops,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.160
you'll feel better right away.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.520
Xueman.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.910
I can see again.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.400
You were in serious danger this time.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.240
If Tong Shuang

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.310
hadn't found that book
about the Ghost Market

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.710
when he went to see Feng Qingzhuo,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.380
I wouldn't have known

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.910
where to go to save you guys.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.120
But your condition...

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.850
I'm completely recovered now.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.430
If you don't believe me,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.490
feel for yourself.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.150
My temperature isn't much different

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.720
from that of a normal person, right?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.870
Although we failed to get the Fire Cicada,

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.920
at least we know

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.290
who has it now.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.150
Once we get the Fire Cicada,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.950
we'll have a chance to detoxify.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.840
By the way, Coroner Feng,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.400
do you know the old man

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.020
we met in the Ghost Market?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.400
I don't.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.630
Then why did he target us?

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.430
He...

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.840
The Ghost Market

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.300
is full of desperate criminals

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.000
and outlaws.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.960
Evil is second nature to them,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.430
so nothing they do

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.890
should come as a surprise.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.640
That's right.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.650
He came straight in asking for

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.590
one of your eyes.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.170
Clearly not a good person.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.160
Xueman...

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.320
You crazy woman.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.270
Trading your eye?

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.600
Have you lost your mind?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.050
He did ask,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.940
but it's not like

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.360
he really wanted my eye.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.400
Coroner Feng,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.760
are you absolutely sure
you don't know him?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.040
I truly don't.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.659
It's just I saw he was hiding poison

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:41.360
in his hand,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.800
so I wanted to stop him.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.360
But my martial skills are too weak,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.750
so I failed to stop him.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.920
Fortunately, you arrived just in time.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.850
Otherwise, today, we would've...

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.560
It's all my fault.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.780
I shouldn't have taken you
to the Ghost Market.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.510
I was the one who insisted on going.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.640
It's not your fault.

You should rest.

go find Zhong Xueman for me.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.630
Yes.

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.310
You know that person
from the Ghost Market, don't you?

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.630
Nothing gets past you.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.930
Is he from your Poison Valley?

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.750
He is Old Bug,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.870
my master's fellow disciple,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.930
the very person who killed my master.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.730
No wonder you fought so desperately
last night.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.830
Old Bug

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.250
is connected to our case.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.000
What do you mean?

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.750
I wanted to tell you

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.270
before the poison knocked you out that

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.000
the person who sold
the hallucinogenic drug to Madam Feng

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.160
might be Old Bug.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.250
How do you prove it?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.180
The reason

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.630
why I know about
the existence of red crystal

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.310
is that I clearly remember

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.570
its documentation in the Yin-Yang Book.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.890
The Yin-Yang Book?

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.430
My grand-master's lifetime knowledge

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.950
was all recorded in the Yin-Yang Book,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.600
which he gave to my master before he died.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.310
Master.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.000

[Yin-Yang Book]

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.690
When will you teach me the Yin-Yang Book?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.930
This acupoint causes slight pain.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:36.920
Got it?

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.310
The reason why he killed my master

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.159
was to steal the Yin-Yang Book.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:42.750
But my Master

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.830
had already given

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.750
that book to me,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.750
so Old Bug failed to get it.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.530
So you're saying

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.070
the red crystal is connected to
the Poison Valley?

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:52.240
Since we found red crystal

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.510
in Huo Zongyaoâ€™s body,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.750
I've been suspecting
it was related to Poison Valley.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.950
But the process of
refining red crystal

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.000
is extremely complex,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.510
achievable only by supreme experts.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.160
Even I can't pull it off.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.030
And in Poison Valley,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.910
nowadays, only

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.670
Old Bug

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:05.800
can refine it.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.510
So Old Bug is very likely

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.560
connected to Yesha.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.310
Old Bug is completely rotten,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.000
capable of any evil deed.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.860
It's a pity that

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.560
he got away last night.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.480
As long as he's still in the capital,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.010
we have a chance to find him.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.030
About your identity,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.290
don't you plan to let them know?

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.370
Someone from Poison Valley

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.470
can't possibly be a good person.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:43.820
Aren't you a good person yourself?

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.790
Not everyone

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.270
thinks like you do.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.960
Trust between people

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.170
is naturally hard to establish

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.960
but easy to dissipate.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.670
I don't want them to misunderstand.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.130
As a friend,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.120
I respect your decision.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.030
But

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.670
you can't keep a secret forever.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:05.840
If one day,

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.840
they discover your true identity,

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:10.310
the misunderstanding could be even worse.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.690
Let me think about it some more.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.600
Miss Huo, what's this about?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.000
My mother was accused of a crime,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.360
so her body was supposed to
be held for investigation.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.240
Being able to bury her
before the investigation

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.480
was all thanks to
the Elite Constabulary Unit's help.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.000
Constable Zhong, if you refuse this meal,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.200
I would feel terribly guilty.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.960
The deceased deserve respect.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.420
Miss Huo, you're too kind.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.910
But I believe you didn't ask me

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.360
to come today

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.600
simply for a meal, right?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.720
If there's something you want to say,
please go ahead.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.840
There is something

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.200
I'd like you to take a look at,
Constable Zhong.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.800
The Huo household's ledger?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.360
This ledger

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.870
was previously managed by Mrs. Huo

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.000
and Li Xiao.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.630
I've just taken over,

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.750
and while reviewing the accounts,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:12.720
I discovered some peculiarities.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.000
If there are issues with
the Huo household's accounts,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.030
why come to me?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.550
Every six months,

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.750
there's a large sum of money transferred
into the Huo household's account.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.360
The money has been transferred

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.270
from Guangsha Villa in the suburbs.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:26.870
But I've checked

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.400
all our family businesses,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.480
and the Huo household and Guangsha Villa

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.200
have never had any

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.390
business dealings.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.150
Guangsha Villa has no reason

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.000
to regularly give money to our household.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.730
So I traced it back to the source

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.750
and examined years of
our household's accounts.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.320
I found that the first transfer

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.050
was actually made 23 years ago.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.120
23 years ago?

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.670
My mother told me before she died

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.200
that I was

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.360
brought back by my father
from the frontier that year.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.000
Also, my mother once told me that

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.400
Chu Guangsha, the owner of Guangsha Villa,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.780
was once my father's personal guard.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.600
Miss Huo.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.080
Why are you telling me

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.150
all this?

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.200
My father is dead,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.790
and so is my mother.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.300
I want to uncover the truth
about my origins.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.440
This is the only lead

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.120
I've been able to find so far.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.440
Perhaps

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:25.720
Mr. Chu

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.580
can provide me with some answers.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.200
But I don't know Mr. Chu,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.930
and I know nothing about Guangsha Villa.

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.550
If I go there unannounced,

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.410
he might get suspicious of me.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.360
Therefore,

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.840
I would like to ask you, Constable Zhong,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.750
to help me uncover

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.810
my true identity as soon as possible.

No problem.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.390
Here you go.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.030
Thanks a lot

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.720
for saving me yesterday.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.870
I never thought

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.600
someone as timid and weak as you

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.660
would actually dare to go to a place

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.920
like the Ghost Market.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.320
I promised Beiming I would save him.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.320
What I promised,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.300
I'd accomplish
even if it might cost my life.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.630
Do you think that crazy woman,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.830
I mean, Zhong Xueman,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.960
would really be willing to give up her eye

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.360
for the Fire Cicada?

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.190
That's a chance to save Beiming.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:12:59.510
She surely won't give it up.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:00.200
After everything

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.660
she did to Beiming before?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.120
No ordinary people could understand

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.840
their relationship.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.440
Let alone an eye,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.120
even if it cost her life,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:11.660
I don't think

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.030
she'd even hesitate.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.160
Coroner Feng.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.670
Well,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.150
I pushed you that day

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.940
and lost my temper with you.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.390
Hit me back,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.050
and we'll be even, okay?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.930
If I hit you,

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.590
wouldn't I be the one in pain?

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:52.530
With all that

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.510
thick skin of yours,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.910
how could I even hurt you?

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.960
Then use a knife.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.000
No way.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.720
You brute.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.320
Stick with calling me Madman, will you?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.150
I'm not used to

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.200
being called Coroner Feng.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.000
Madman.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.150
That sounds much better.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.840
I've checked the ledger carefully,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.000
and the payments from Guangsha Villa
to the Huo household

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.480
indeed

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.080
started 23 years ago.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.840
That year, General Huo Zongyao

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.200
had just returned from Haiya.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:15.960
If Chu Guangsha

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.550
really was General Huo's personal guard,

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.840
then he must have been to Haiya too,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.600
and would have just returned
from there as well.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.260
But you don't know

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.790
Huo Dairong's intentions.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.360
When we were investigating
the Huo Mansion case,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.240
she deliberately led us to

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.510
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao,

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.200
and also intentionally revealed

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.550
such an important clue.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.430
Was all that really just

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.550
to uncover the truth about her origins?

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.870
Whatever her purpose might be,

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.320
since it concerns Haiya,

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.050
we must get to the bottom of it.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.360
I'll go with her.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.240
You stay here

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.320
and wait for our news.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.270
She knows your identity,

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.320
and if she intends to harm you...

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.480
Even if she wants to harm me,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.720
I can't escape it anyway,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.960
so I might as well face it head-on.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.550
Perhaps

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.460
we can find a weakness in her plan.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:59.690
[Qi]

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.600
Beiming. Constable Zhong.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.600
I've asked around.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.120
Chu Guangsha did serve in the military,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.030
then he retired to civilian life

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.720
and somehow got

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.780
a large sum of money

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.630
to establish Guangsha Villa.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.840
Over these years, Chu Guangsha
has been devoted to spiritual pursuits,

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.930
regularly associating
with the Immortal Masters

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.070
from Qingtai Mountain.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.150
It's said he seeks immortality,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.390
to cultivate and ascend.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.600
Immortality?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.550
Seems like he truly has attained
everything he wants.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.350
Chu Guangsha was just a soldier,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.150
yet he suddenly acquired
such a large fortune.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.750
That money is highly suspicious,

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.120
definitely from questionable sources.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.850
Whether he's man or ghost,
we'll know at a glance.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.000
Let's go.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.710
It's alright.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.480
We're far from the capital now.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.880
No one will recognize me.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.150
what happy occasion

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.510
is Guangsha Villa celebrating today?

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.320
Don't you know?

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.360
The master is hosting a grand banquet
for his birthday.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.720
Word is the Immortal Masters
from Qingtai Mountain

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.550
have developed

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.410
a rejuvenating immortality pill

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.030
and have personally brought it here

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.510
as a birthday gift for the master.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:35.480
And the master

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.320
will take

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.240
this immortality pill himself
during the banquet.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:38.960
We are also

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.400
just here to join the fun.

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.670
I won't say more.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.810
I'm going in ahead.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.000
Thank you.

Honored guests, please come in.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.320
Not even asking who we are?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.380
Master has instructed

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.080
that today, no matter who it is,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.390
anyone who passes through this gate

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.480
is an honored guest.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.790
Your master is quite generous.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.480
Aren't you worried

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.030
we're just here for free food?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.200
You jest.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.349
This is Guangsha Villa after all,
originating from the line

"If I had thousands of spacious houses,

under heaven, making them smile with joy."

Your master

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.710
truly is a warm-hearted person.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.349
I've always told you to read more books.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.150
What, feeling embarrassed now?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.550

That's the young Immortal Master
from Qingtai Mountain

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.680
who came to deliver the pill
to our master.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.400
Won't he stay for the banquet?

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.240
Well, these Immortal Masters

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.750
never stay long in mortal residences.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.310
Being contaminated by worldly stuff

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.770
would affect their spiritual cultivation.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.920
please follow me.

I have a feeling

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.440
something's off here.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.030
Let's stay alert.

to the celestial fruits on the table.

Since we're already here,

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.400
we might as well enjoy the show.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.510

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.110

the Immortal Master's reputation.

spotted the issue immediately.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.310
I found a large amount of red crystal

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.440
in the remnants of the pill

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.960
in Chu Guangsha's stomach.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.880
I suspect that so-called immortality pill

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.240
is the source of the poison.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.900
But Chu Guangsha's poisoning

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.070
differs from Huo Zongyao's

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.070
in several ways.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.220
What's different?

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.340
Huo Zongyao's red crystal

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:55.960
was administered in

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.270
his health-preserving tea

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.720
in small amounts,
which was difficult to detect.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.270
He consumed it for half a year,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.960
resulting in chronic poisoning eventually.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.030
But Chu Guangsha's situation is different.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:03.720
His brain tissue

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.000
isn't riddled with holes

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.110
like Huo Zongyao's.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.000
And his eyes, ears, and nose

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.350
contain large amounts of black blood.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.310
This proves

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:11.440
he consumed a large amount

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.960
of red crystal in a short time,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.750
ultimately dying
from brain tissue rupture.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:15.810
So you're saying

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.480
someone wanted him dead today?

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.280
That's right.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:20.110
We just tracked it down to Chu Guangsha,

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.110
and he died.

and get people killed?

[Baiyun Temple]

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.200
Who are you?

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.790
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.510
I'm Constable Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:00.750
These three are my colleagues.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.920
We're here to visit

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.960
regarding the Guangsha Villa case.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.160
Master is inside the temple.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.760
Please follow me, Officers.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.030
[Baiyun Temple]

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.750
Nonsense!

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.430
Mr. Chu had deep ties
with our Qingtai Mountain

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.890
with profound blessings.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.720
Every immortality pill he took

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.310
was personally made by me.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.830
For the past six months,
every month on the 15th,

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.270
I'd have my disciples

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.830
deliver the prepared immortality pills

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.720
personally into Mr. Chu's hands.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.440
There's never been any mistake.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.270
You claim that Mr. Chu

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.270
had poison in the pill in his stomach,

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.000
and you suspect his death

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.790
is connected to our Qingtai Mountain?

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.190
Do you have any evidence?

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.480
Immortal Master,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.550
we're not suspecting you,

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.720
just eliminating possibilities.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.000
It's merely routine.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.680
Do you have any remaining

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:09.640
immortality pills left?

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.720
I have some knowledge

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.580
about immortality pills myself.

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:14.290
This immortality pill

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.810
is the finest from the immortal realm.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.920
It's nothing like what you'd find

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.350
in ordinary pharmacies
in the mortal world.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:24.070
Moreover, this pill was obtained by me

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.160
sacrificing my own lifespan
and spiritual power,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:28.160
requested from the immortal realm.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.640
Therefore, once a pill is created,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:31.200
the user

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.160
must take it within one day,

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.880
or it loses all efficacy.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.070
So how could there be any

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.110
remaining pills?

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.240
What about the formula then?

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:43.030
Do you have the formula?

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.070
That would work too.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.960
The formula?

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.200
The formula has always been kept alone by

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.400
one Immortal Master of each generation.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.730
How could I possibly let outsiders see it?

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.480
This is purely absurd.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:54.310
Immortal Master.

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.310
Respected Immortal Master.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:57.070
We're just investigating a case,

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.790
which is the duty of
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.390
So please cooperate with us.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.000
Respected Immortal Master.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.720
The pill did come from here.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.400
If you cannot prove

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.310
that the poison in Mr. Chu's body

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:09.030
has nothing to do with you,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:09.640
then we must ask you

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.640
to come with us.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.970
Are you trying to arrest me?

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:18.400
Fine.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.400
I'll go with you.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:22.550
I'd like to see

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.550
how your Elite Constabulary Unit

00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:24.440
manages to

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720
twist the truth

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.250
and frame innocent people.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.440
Respected Immortal Master.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.700
Please don't be upset.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.470
That's not what we meant.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.890
Please sit down.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.640
Chu Guangsha took the pill

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.770
and died on the spot.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.920
This matter has significant implications.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.110
Respected Immortal Master, I believe you

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.070
wouldn't want rumors spreading out there,

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.070
claiming that Mr. Chu's death

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.110
is related to the pills
from Qingtai Mountain, right?

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.640
What this officer says

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.240
does make some sense.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.240
However, as for the formula,

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.240
I still cannot let you have it.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.000
Respected Immortal Master, you...

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Constable Zhong.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.560
Respected Immortal Master.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.880
However, I do have

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.360
a few defective pills in my possession.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.550
Defective pills?

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.350
Yes.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.830
You may not know that

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.190
in fact,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.440
the pill-making process

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.330
doesn't always go

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:24.350
smoothly.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.720
If the heat, climate,

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.510
or the proportion of ingredients

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.640
is slightly off,

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.480
it will affect

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.210
the final efficacy of the pill.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.960
Some poorly made immortality pills

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.400
become defective pills.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.440
Given how profound our spiritual bond

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.480
with Mr. Chu was,

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.880
how could we possibly give

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.310
those defective pills to him?

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.480
Respected Immortal Master.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.880
Actually, we just need to take a look at

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.400
the ingredients of the pill.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.000
The quality doesn't matter.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:49.590
Then

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:53.350
sorry to trouble you,
Respected Immortal Master.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.110
Jiu.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.480
No matter what the officers ask you,

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.830
you must answer truthfully.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.310
No hiding. Understand?

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.830
Yes, Master.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.310
Thank you, Respected Immortal Master.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.640
[Jiu, Disciple of Qingtai Mountain]

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.680
You've always been the one
delivering the immortality pills, right?

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:23.480
Or has anyone else handled them?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.830
No.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.550
After each immortality pill is made,

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.720
to preserve its immortal essence,

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.350
Master would put it

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.400
in a jade box

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.400
and then hand it to me.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.880
After that, I'd deliver it
to Guangsha Villa.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.510
I've always delivered the pills alone.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:34.200
Absolutely no one else

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:34.960
has ever touched the pills.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.720
And the person who received the pills,

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.110
was it Chu Guangsha himself,

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.170
or someone else from Guangsha Villa?

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.750
Of course it was Mr. Chu himself.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.550
The immortality pills cannot be tainted
by mundane energy.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.150
If ordinary people touch it,

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.880
the pills will be contaminated.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.640
So it's always been

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.440
Mr. Chu who personally received it.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.400
So you're saying

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.790
the only people who have touched

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.070
the immortality pills are
the Immortal Master,

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.480
you, and Chu Guangsha?

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:54.830
No, no, Miss Huo.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.000
I only deliver them.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.660
I've never touched the pills.

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:02.160
Immortal Jiu, you're also a cultivator.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.480
When delivering the pills,

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.510
weren't you ever curious

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:05.160
about what this immortality pill

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.480
that can transform a mortal
into an immortal

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.680
actually looks like?

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.650
I wouldn't dare.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.270
After each pill is made,

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.480
Master would personally place it

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:12.640
in a jade box

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.270
and seal it with fire clay directly.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.970
And he'd add his personal seal.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.550
If I were to open it during delivery,

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.350
it would definitely be discovered.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.350
No matter how curious I might be,

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.950
I wouldn't dare do anything.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.000
The distance from Qingtai Mountain

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.590
to Guangsha Villa

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.790
isn't exactly short.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.880
How did you deliver the pills,
Immortal Jiu?

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.960
By foot.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.960
By foot?

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.280
That's right.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.520
What you guys may not know is that

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.590
hardship

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.880
is the foundation of our

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.030
immortal cultivation practice.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.440
So all disciples of our Qingtai Mountain,

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.110
no matter where they go,

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.880
can only rely on their own feet.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.350
This is also to

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:52.790
show the immortals

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.440
our sincere devotion.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.240
On foot?

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.000
How long does that take?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.030
Noon is when the yang energy

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.240
is at its peak,

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.070
and also the best time

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.240
for the immortality pill to be completed.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.350
And Jiu must arrive by 7 PM,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.550
before the sun sets

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.190
and when yin and yang start to shift,

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.230
to deliver the immortality pill

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.440
to the recipient.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.550
So the round-trip journey

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:13.320
has become

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.580
a path of cultivation for our disciples.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.610
It's a difficult journey.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920
Is there no place

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.120
to rest along the way?

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.960
The delivery of the pill was urgent.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.889
I wouldn't dare rest along the way.

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.800
We have no further questions.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.659
Thank you for your help,
Respected Immortal Master and Immortal Jiu.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.320
After we finish examining
the defective pill,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.580
we will provide you with an explanation.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.550
What are you trying to do?

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:44.440
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.770
You're from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.200
What are you doing here
in the Ghost Market?

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.670
Nothing special.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.670
I just need to ask you something.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:53.590
Tell me the truth.

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:55.630
You'd better not go looking for trouble

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.830
when things are fine.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.430
Young Master.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.190
Got news about Zhong Xueman's whereabouts?

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:19.880
There's been a murder at Guangsha Villa.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.630
Zhong Xueman and several other

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:23.070
constables from
the Elite Constabulary went there.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.550
Guangsha Villa?

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:27.630
What murder?

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.550
I heard that the villa owner,
Chu Guangsha,

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:31.950
dropped dead during his birthday banquet.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.680
Young Master.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.000
Chief has ordered that

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.530
all members of
the Secret Investigation Unit

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.280
should focus entirely on investigating

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.670
leads about Yesha and Xiao Beiming

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.200
and ignore all other cases.

00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:42.730
Besides, this case

00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:45.400
is currently being handled by
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.070
There's no need to inform Chief
about this matter yet.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.870
I'll take responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:55.730
I have the results.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.440
What did you find?

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.800
All that talk about
extending lifespan and spiritual power.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.630
It's nothing but

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:04.510
ordinary tonics

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.570
mixed with mercury and yellow stone.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.760
The one in Chu Guangsha's stomach

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.230
was at least made with red crystal,

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.920
but this one

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.440
doesn't contain any red crystal at all.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.510
You mean

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.070
the pill developed by the Elder Immortal

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.840
and the one Chu Guangsha took
are different?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.800
Exactly.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.870
Now here's the strange part.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.230
That young Immortal claims

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.760
he carried the pill with him
the entire time along the way,

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.590
and that he never

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.360
encountered anyone

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.880
or had contact with others.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.670
If someone wanted to switch the pill,

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.200
how could they have done it?

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.960
That Immortal Jiu was lying.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.030
Lying?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.360
I noticed his expression

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.800
was indeed somewhat nervous,

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800
but ordinary people

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.400
would naturally be nervous

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.800
facing interrogation from
the Elite Constabulary Unit, right?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.730
He had other subtle movements too.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:49.280
You mean his buttocks?

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.540
Not just his buttocks,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:51.550
but also his hips.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.630
He was injured,

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.230
and quite recently too.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.510
What could he have been doing

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:06.310
to injure his hips and buttocks?

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.770
Horseback riding?

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.280
I also noticed that the skin

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.630
between his thumb and index finger
was swollen and inflamed,

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:12.920
suggesting he's not skilled at riding

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.000
and had been pulling on the reins
for a long time.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.440
So that young Immortal
was indeed deceiving us.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.280
He didn't follow

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.000
his master's instructions to travel
on foot as hardship cultivation at all.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.590
He delivered the pill on horseback.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:22.230
Riding a horse

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.670
to Guangsha Villa takes

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.280
much less time than walking.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.440
During this time,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.920
he could have done all sorts of things.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:29.510
We should hurry to Qingtai Mountain then.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.310
It'll be trouble if he gets away.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:33.550
Where's Constable Zhong?
