[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 21]

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.340
What happened?

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.590
Tong Shuang and Coroner Feng

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.430
went to look for clues about Old Bug,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.800
while I was preparing food for Beiming,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.200
and then I fainted.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.890
I've checked in on her.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.550
She was drugged unconscious.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.710
Sorry,

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.430
I should have been more cautious.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.229
It's okay. It's not your fault.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
If I find out who did this,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.400
I'll skin them alive.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.450
Could Zhuge Kongyun be behind this?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.790
I was with him the whole time.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.760
He didn't have the chance

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.710
or any reason to do this.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.680
Then who did it?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.050
It could only be Old Bug.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.560
Beiming suspected that Huang Wuchang

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.120
was kidnapped by someone using poison.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.140
I just asked Zhuge Kongyun

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.980
to verify it,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.000
and he was indeed drugged unconscious.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.960
And Old Bug escaped

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.360
from Dingfeng Pavilion.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.800
I've thought it through,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.460
and he's the most suspicious.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.310
You're awake.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.030
Wasn't Old Bug

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.280
working on the antidote?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.910
Why would he catch Beiming?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.540
Old Bug's words can't be trusted.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.210
Even if he doesn't kill him,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.120
there's still a madman, Huang Wuchang.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.360
If he wants to get back at us...

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.150
Calm down.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.190
If they wanted

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.450
to end Beiming's life,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.200
they could've killed him here.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.590
Xueman, could you

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.110
go ask the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.840
or the Secret Investigation Unit

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.470
for reinforcements

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.520
to help us?

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.360
The Secret Investigation Unit

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.630
is already looking for Old Bug.

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.430
That's great!

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.630
The more people searching,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.690
the higher the chance of finding him.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.520
Wait, no.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.750
If Old Bug was the one who caught Beiming,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.910
when the Unit finds Old Bug,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.360
wouldn't Beiming be exposed?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.820
We're running out of time.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.120
Exposed or not,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.090
Beiming can't

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.170
hold out that long.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.150
The only solution now

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.430
is to find Old Bug

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.360
before the Unit does,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.310
rescue Beiming,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.430
and then try to force

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.120
Old Bug to detoxify Beiming.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.680
Xueman,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.750
you're our pillar of strength now.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.150
You can't give up easily.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.240
We need to keep finding solutions.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.630
What's the progress

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.280
on the Yesha case?

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.680
What did you two,

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.360
father and son, promise me?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.590
Tell me

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.710
your plan.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.600
I didn't do my job well,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.560
failed to crack the Yesha case
as promised,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.310
and betrayed your trust.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.800
I deserve death for this failure.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.800
Shut up.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.840
Zhuge Kongyun, I want to hear from you.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.710
The key criminal, Huang Wuchang,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.150
escaped from my custody.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.240
I deserve death for this failure.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.910
I don't want to hear your death wishes!

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.680
If you want to die,
do it back at your unit!

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.840
I want the case solved and Yesha arrested!

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.800
I want the truth!

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.390
Your Majesty,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.480
I have found clues

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.040
about Huang Wuchang's abduction.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.920
It's related to a wandering physician

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.829
from Poison Valley

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.040
named Old Bug.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.360
This person is also linked to Yesha.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.520
Your Majesty,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.160
please grant me three more days.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.360
I promise I will capture

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.650
Old Bug and Huang Wuchang

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.630
within three days.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.890
If I fail, I accept immediate execution!

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.870
Your pressure points have been sealed.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.000
Stop struggling.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.270
If you wanted to detoxify me,

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.000
there was no need to go to such lengths

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.240
to bring me here.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.510
Who said I brought you here

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.950
to cure you?

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.160
Can't I just kill you?

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.040
Seems like you lied

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.100
to Feng Qingzhuo quite a bit that day.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.190
Yesha told you to do so, huh?

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.160
What else do you know?

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.950
Only someone using poison could've

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.120
kidnapped Huang Wuchang

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.800
from the Secret Investigation Unit

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.120
without hurting anyone there.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.390
And in this world,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.360
no one else

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.070
can wield poison with such mastery

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.480
as you.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.880
You told Feng Qingzhuo before

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920
that Yesha hired you,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.159
and that was all.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360
But you risked

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360
exposing yourself

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.890
to take Huang Wuchang away,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.720
which proves your relationship with Yesha

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.920
is far from ordinary.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.040
Go on.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.400
Huang Wuchang is just

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.070
a madman who knows nothing about medicine.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.510
As important as the red crystal is,

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.270
how could Yesha possibly entrust it

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.000
to a madman for safekeeping?

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.680
I guess

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.130
Huang Wuchang is merely an executor.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.950
And you

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.870
are the true mastermind

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.600
behind the Yellow Heaven cult.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.040
But the Yin-Yang Book is

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.600
way too important to you.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.950
For the Book,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.680
you were willing to leak clues
about the red crystal,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.040
which led to Huang Wuchang's capture

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.120
in Weizhou.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.570
If Yesha hears about it,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600
he will surely vent his anger on you.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.950
By then, your life

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.010
might be in danger.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.720
Therefore, to make amends,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.360
you rescued Huang Wuchang.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.720
You never fail to impress, Xiao Beiming.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.440
You've been Yesha's subordinate
the whole time.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.370
What exactly did he order you to do?

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.120
You're about to die anyway,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.430
so what's the point

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.920
of knowing this?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.450
You have the upper hand,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.150
and I'm at your mercy.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.120
You're right. It's pointless.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.750
But there's

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.240
one thing that still confuses me.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.360
Back at Dingfeng Pavilion,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.950
you could have killed me.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.240
Why did you bother

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.560
bringing me all the way here?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.360
Could it be

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.830
that I'm still useful to you
in some way?

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.120
I will kill you for sure.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.260
But before you die,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.950
I do have other business to attend to.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.360
What do you mean?

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.760
Turns out you don't know enough

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.560
about me yet.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.240
In my years in the martial world,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.500
I've always held onto loyalty and faith.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.680
Since I promised to cure you,

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.310
I must keep my word.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.480
Most importantly,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.860
the poison in your body

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.880
was created by my Senior Wushuang,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.160
that old wretch.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.390
If I can't detoxify you,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.040
wouldn't that be telling everyone

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.240
that I've lost to him?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.680
So no matter what,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.120
I must cure you.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.950
Makes sense.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.270
You were right just now.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360
You destroyed Yellow Heaven

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.680
and snatched the red crystal.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.360
Yesha indeed took it out on me.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.510
Saving Huang Wuchang

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.840
is nowhere near enough.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.800
I

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.430
need to use your life

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.680
to save my own.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.750
I get it.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.040
Cure me first

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.430
and kill me then.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.010
You can keep both your faith

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.560
and your reputation.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.720
You will neither offend Yesha

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.040
nor lose your life.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.950
It's quite a perfect solution.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.190
So, have you figured out

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.360
how to cure me?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.360
I do have some ideas.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.270
However,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.600
back at your place,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.310
I couldn't give

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.560
full play to my techniques

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.660
in case your companions would see

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.680
and fight me to the death.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.460
Are you going to tie someone else up?

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.790
Are you from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.190
I have something for you.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.870
Where did you get this cloth?

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.080
Well...

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.720
Tell me

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.670
who gave you this cloth.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.480
It was an old man with long hair

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.200
who brought a sick young man with him.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.840
He gave me this

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.910
and told me to find

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.720
a lady in a constable's uniform.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.680
Where is that young man now?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.910
Can you take me to him?

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.270
Okay.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:07.790
Come on.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.440
It's right there.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.870
Are you sure it's here?

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:18.440
Yes.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.030
Here, go buy yourself some candied haws.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.600
Thank you, miss.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.200
Go.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.810
[Mortal World's Pure Land]

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.000
Beiming!

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.670
Beiming.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.990
Shame on you!

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.550
Last time you knocked me out,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.120
while this time I knocked you out.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.390
A blow for a blow.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.910
Fair enough, isn't it?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.780
What are you doing?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.870
I'm detoxifying

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.000
your lover.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.780
You should say thank you to me.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.150
Beiming!

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.510
Xueman!

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.960
Do whatever you want with me,

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.840
but let her go!

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.870
Old Bug.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.120
Old Bu...

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:43.320
Sir,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.070
please let her go.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.550
Old Bug,

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.000
I'm warning you.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:50.890
If you dare

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:52.200
to do anything to Beiming,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.550
I swear I will kill you!

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.520
Come at me.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.910
She's innocent.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.120
If you let her go,

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.960
-I will never try to escape.
-Old Bug, I told you...

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.120
Enough, you two!

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.200
Do you even realize your situation?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.910
I'm asked to free

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.000
both you and her.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.960
Hey! I'm the kidnapper!

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.120
Why should I take orders from you?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.000
Just cut the crap.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:10.800
Neither of you

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:12.840
is getting away.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.320
What exactly do you want?

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.600
Haven't you been wondering

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.360
how I'm going to remove

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.890
that poison from your body?

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.610
Your Junior Xueman is your antidote.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.720
What do you mean?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.300
Blood-exchange therapy.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.790
Have you ever heard of it?

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.670
I'll exchange your junior's clean blood

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.730
with the poisoned blood in your body.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.200
Whether I can defeat that old wretch

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.680
depends on your junior now.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.550
Don't think about tongue-biting suicide.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.010
I've made it pretty clear.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.850
You can only die
after your poison is removed.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.480
Don't try to ruin my plan!

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.410
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.870
What a pair of star-crossed lovers.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.960
But it's okay.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.550
Neither of you will survive today.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.950
At least you won't be lonely
on your way to the underworld.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.960
Wait!

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.960
What do you want again?

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.270
You'll have to wait for your turn.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.910
One at a time. Be patient.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.550
Using blood-exchange therapy to detoxify,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.480
do you really think

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.480
you can defeat your senior this way?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.960
What do you mean by that?

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.960
If you replace
my senior's blood with mine,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.420
will he still be the same person
he used to be?

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.210
Will he count as a man or a woman?

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.720
His poisoned blood might be gone,

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.320
but the poison itself will still be there.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.180
You're only deceiving yourself!

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.980
When you meet
the Unstoppable Old Man in the underworld,

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.260
he will only mock you,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.360
jeering at your incompetence

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.360
-and your dirty tricks!
-Nonsense!

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.840
As long as Xiao Beiming is still alive,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.910
it doesn't matter how I do it!

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.910
Then go ahead!

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.960
Use that therapy,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.120
and you'll never

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.120
be able to defeat your senior.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.750
Impossible!

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:21.550
No way!

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.390
No way I couldn't

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:23.720
defeat that old wretch!

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.480
I will definitely beat him!

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.510
I will definitely beat

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.200
that old wretch!

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.550
Beiming is missing,

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.790
and so is Constable Zhong.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.470
I don't know you.

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.840
Be quiet!

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.550
Who are you?

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.320
I told you to be quiet!

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.200
Did you hear me?

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.140
-Who are you?
-Go.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.080
-I won't go with you.
-Tong Shuang!

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.750
Stop there.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.550
S-Stand still.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.480
What are you doing?

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.080
Someone saw Constable Zhong

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.360
going with this child

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.720
to the western suburbs.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.130
I'll ask you one more time.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.870
Where is that lady?

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.670
I don't know.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:47.360
You don't know?

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.120
Stop fooling me!

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.850
Tong Shuang,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.790
you're scaring him.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.510
Kid, tell me

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.910
if you've seen a lady

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:54.720
with a small golden hammer.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.240
Tell me everything

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:55.840
you know,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:56.360
okay?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.030
Tell me.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.670
Have you seen her?

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.510
Tell me!

00:13:58.840 --> 00:13:59.600
Say something!

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600
Alright, alright.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.360
I've asked numerous times.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:01.750
Relax.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.630
Let's ignore him.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.670
So boy,

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.960
what's your name?

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.120
My name is Shitou.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.320
Good boy.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.810
Are you hungry, Shitou?

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.670
Wait here.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.680
I'll get you something delicious.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.750
Sir.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.750
Here.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:19.390
Thanks.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.670
Take this.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:29.960
Eat up.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.960
Thanks to this girl,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.320
I've come up with a method

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.150
that I've never tried before.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.410
However,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.080
it is quite risky.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.870
And for you,

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.720
the chances of survival are slim.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.320
But I've thought it through.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.550
Even if detoxification fails,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.910
and you die, it doesn't matter!

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:04.600
I'll transfer the poison from your body

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.800
to your Junior Xueman

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.000
and keep working on a cure.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.630
Anyway,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.210
I will never admit defeat.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.150
Since you think I must die,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.480
at least let me know the truth
before I go.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.360
Okay.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.120
After all, you're giving me

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.480
a chance to defeat that old wretch.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.960
To repay you,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.480
I'll answer three of your questions.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.360
Who is Yesha?

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.150
Don't ask about his identity.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.120
He never shows his true face.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.270
What does Yesha want from you?

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.550
Medicine.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.360
Forging red crystal requires obsidian,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.960
corpse oil, and human blood.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.160
That's why I had

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.910
Huang Wuchang and his men search for them.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.000
As for what those lunatics want to do,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.840
it's none of my business,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.910
and I don't care.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.970
What's the purpose
of making this medicine?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.720
Sir,

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.210
you promised to answer
three questions of mine.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.330
You can't go back on your word.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.480
Fine.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.750
Then I'll be honest with you.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.720
I'm making a supreme elixir.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.870
Previously,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.870
Huo Zongyao and Chu Guangsha

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:11.870
only consumed

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.910
an unfinished version

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:14.960
of this elixir.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.360
Yet it was enough to

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.870
send them to their graves.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.480
Upon the completion of this elixir,

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.360
the world will change,
and the Qi Kingdom will fall.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.150
And I

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.270
will become someone

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.120
that all poison masters and physicians

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.120
throughout the land must look up to.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.840
Alright,

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:42.030
we're done with your three questions.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.480
We can begin now.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.980
Little White Dragon has tried

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.270
your acupuncture technique on me.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.200
It didn't work.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:53.840
Don't compare me

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.200
to that useless fool.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.390
The technique I use

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.080
is one that even his Master,
that old wretch,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.320
wouldn't dare to try.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.080
Then what technique will you use?

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.770
Meridian Modification with Golden Needles.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.440
Meridian Modification?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.160
That's right.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.200
The poison in your body

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.069
flows through

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.680
your meridian channels.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.069
I'll use golden needles

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.069
to separate part of your meridians

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.200
into obsolete channels,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.349
and then force the poison
into those channels.

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:19.160
This way, the poison

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.960
will remain in your body,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.030
but you can

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.480
survive relying on your other meridians.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.960
Once the Meridian Modification succeeds,

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.550
you'll not only regain
your internal energy,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.240
but the poison

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:31.960
will also be unable to affect you anymore.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.880
Can something ineffective

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.210
still be called poison?

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.480
So it'll count

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.410
as me beating that old wretch.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.350
Impressive.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.970
Of course it's impressive.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.510
This was developed by me

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.510
and his master, that old wretch.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.590
However,

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.000
to separate the meridians in the body

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.680
is excruciating pain,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.160
barely better than death
by a thousand cuts.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.350
I've tried it on many people,

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.920
but

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.920
none of them survived.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.070
It's not a slim chance of survival;

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.750
it's more like

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.480
no chance at all.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.440
If there's no chance, why even try?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.720
What if this man

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.880
lucks out?

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.160
I still have to give it a try.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.550
Just use me for the blood-exchange!

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.280
Ignore my previous gibberish!

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.640
Use me for the blood-exchange!

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.680
Take my blood!

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.110
Use my blood!

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.310
Use my blood instead!

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.720
So annoying.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.240
Old Bug is too despicable,

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.800
utilizing a child to cheat.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.160
What a jerk.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.270
Save them.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.860
Tong Shuang, don't be rash.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.350
How about this?

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.240
You go back first

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.030
and wait for my message.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.160
You must be careful.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.070
Have you found Old Bug

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.510
and Huang Wuchang?

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:07.730
When the three days are up,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.480
if we still can't capture these two,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.240
we will certainly be put to death.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.030
Father,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.880
given that situation,

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.880
if I hadn't promised His Majesty

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.140
a three-day deadline,

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.960
we'd probably

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.160
have ended up in jail.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.410
I made that promise

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.640
not out of impulse.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.750
Someone might be able to help us.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.720
What do you mean?

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.160
Don't worry, Father.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.590
There will be news soon.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.920
Can't believe you're still alive.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:37.830
Everyone who has undergone

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.110
this Meridian Modification,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.910
with no exception,

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.920
couldn't survive the entire process.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.070
You truly are a tough man

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.550
to have pulled through till the end.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
The Meridian Modification is done,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.360
and you're still alive.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.640
This means the Blood-freezing Frost

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.000
has been controlled by me.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:54.720
How's that,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.680
old wretch?

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.830
See? Old wretch!

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.110
You lost!

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.550
You lost!

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.350
I knew

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.590
I could defeat you.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.560
I could definitely beat you.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.720
Brilliant!

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.640
I've been waiting for this day

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.790
for half my life.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.270
For half my lifetime!

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.140
Don't look at me like that.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.760
You should be grateful to me.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.440
I'm the one who cured him.

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.550
Oh, no.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.160
I forgot.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.680
You should indeed resent me,

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.310
because once I've removed

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.110
his poison,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.660
I'll kill him immediately

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.810
and send him to hell

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.790
for my senior to check it out.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:40.720
That old wretch.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.270
I've finally beaten you.

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.750
I've finally succeeded!

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.270
Your internal energy is not bad.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.070
It seems you two are truly in love.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.790
Then I'll grant you both your wish.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:00.720
I'll kill him first,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.050
and then it's your turn!

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.920
Constable Zhong!

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:34.590
Feng Qingzhuo, go check on Beiming.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.070
Beiming!

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.310
Save him now!

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.960
Beiming! Beiming!

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.510
Beiming!

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.090
He's still breathing.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.350
Constable Zhong.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.170
Meridian Modification with Golden Needles?

00:23:58.790 --> 00:23:59.400
Go.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.420
I need to talk

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.550
to Old Bug alone.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.720
You take Beiming back first.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.880
Leave you alone? But...

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.610
Don't worry,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.920
he's no match for me.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.310
Old Bug is absolutely insane,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.810
detoxifying by Meridian Modification
with Golden Needles.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.110
Now the meridians have been modified,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.840
and the poison has been sealed.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.590
I'm wondering

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.650
how Beiming managed to survive this.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.470
So you're saying Beiming is fine?

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
That's good news.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.640
You should be happy.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:39.510
It'll be fine if he wakes up.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.330
I'm just afraid...

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.310
I'm afraid...

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.670
W-What are you afraid of?

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.620
I'm afraid that Beiming won't come around.

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.680
Won't come around?

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.580
Didn't you say he was detoxified?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.960
As far as I know,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.680
no one has ever survived
the Meridian Modification

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.880
with Golden Needles.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.170
Then hurry and do something

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.350
to save him!

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.180
There's nothing we can do.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.440
It depends on him now.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.830
How can he help himself?

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.750
He can't even get up right now!

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.680
How is he supposed to save himself?

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.880
Take all these medicines you have,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.920
and let's figure out a way.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.400
Let's try

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.440
to save Beiming, okay?

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440
Let's give it a try, huh?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.700
If I could save him, I would have already.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.030
The only thing we can do now

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.590
is believe in him.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.240
Beiming survived
such a treacherous procedure

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.270
as Meridian Modification
with Golden Needles.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:40.110
It means that God blesses him.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:41.960
He still has Xueman

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.300
and so many things to take care of.

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.070
I believe he will wake up.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.960
No, I need to meet Constable Zhong.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.550
She's still

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:01.750
staying with Old Bug.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960
As cunning and skilled

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.110
in poison as Old Bug is,

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.720
the Secret Investigation Unit

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.750
certainly can't protect her.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.790
I'd turn to the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.510
Hold on.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.090
You're too slow.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:11.920
You guys guard Beiming,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.000
I'll go.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.720
Chief.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:17.880
Come in.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.880
Chief, Young Master.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.160
Something's up
with the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.720
Fang Tianzheng has taken several men

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.050
to the western suburbs.

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.270
You're at my mercy now,

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.680
and I also have three questions for you.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.200
If you tell me the truth,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.720
when we return
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.240
I can ensure

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.440
you suffer less.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.920
First question.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.880
Where is Huang Wuchang now?

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400
Second question.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:53.960
What is Yesha up to

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.160
with those elixirs he asked you to make?

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.090
Third question.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.590
Who is Yesha?

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.510
Come closer.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.790
I'll tell you.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:15.960
Come.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.960
The key criminal is here!

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.640
Surround the Yaksha Temple immediately!

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.270
Fang Yin, take people this way.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.160
Tong Shuang, lead your men that way.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.480
-Okay.
-Hurry!

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.310
Chief Fang!

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.480
Want all the credit for yourself?

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.270
Isn't that a bit too greedy?

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.350
Chief Zhuge,

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.550
you're quite eager to steal the credit!

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.400
Elite Constabulary Unit, make the arrest!

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:45.640
Yes!

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.790
Secret Investigation Unit, move!

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.560
Yes, sir!

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.960
Come on, keep up!

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.360
What on earth happened?

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.640
I have no idea either.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.240
I didn't kill that man.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.960
That's a groundless claim!

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.110
At the scene,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.240
there were only you and Old Bug.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.920
What?

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.350
Did Old Bug

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.510
set himself on fire?

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.350
Chief, when we captured Old Bug,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.110
I was there too.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.720
It was Constable Zhong

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.160
who sent me back
to the Elite Constabulary Unit for help.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.200
Besides, Old Bug was

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.720
completely subdued at that time.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.620
Constable Zhong had no reason

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:50.590
to kill him.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.680
If he was subdued,

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.240
why didn't you bring him back to our unit?

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.680
Now we have no evidence.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.070
What now?

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.310
How do we handle this?

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.310
Uncle, Zhong Xueman is

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.950
indeed rude and aggressive.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.550
But I don't think she'd kill anyone.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.350
Right, Feng?

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.830
Yes.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.590
Chief,

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.510
I believe Xueman

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.310
would never commit murder.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.110
Your trust in her means nothing!

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.030
Without evidence,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.760
the Secret Investigation Unit
won't let this go!

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.030
According to your statement,

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:18.350
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.510
you were first
drugged unconscious by Old Bug.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.250
When you were in a coma,

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.750
someone killed Old Bug

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.160
and framed you for it.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.410
But where's your evidence?

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.720
If I had evidence,

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:30.750
would I be here

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:31.830
being interrogated by you?

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.750
Insolent!

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.400
Zhong Xueman, don't think that

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.720
just because your father
was the King of Constables,

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.320
you can do whatever you want!

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.160
Listen,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.070
you are now a murder suspect

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.820
and must confess truthfully.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:43.590
Chief Zhuge.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.750
Chief Zhuge,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:53.790
I'm not covering

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.160
for my own subordinate.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.030
All the evidence now indicates

00:30:58.270 --> 00:30:59.830
that Constable Zhong committed the murder.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:00.720
At the crime scene,

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.440
there's no evidence suggesting

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.720
that anyone else

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.510
was there to kill Old Bug.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.240
But

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:08.350
what would be Zhong Xueman's

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:09.920
motive for killing Old Bug?

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.600
And after killing someone,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.110
she didn't flee the scene.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.160
She just stayed there,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.310
waiting for you to arrest her.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.720
That doesn't make any sense.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.960
Don't all these inconsistencies

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.110
suggest

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.070
that someone framed Constable Zhong

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.440
for this crime?

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.480
Framed her?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.530
Where's your evidence?

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.440
Everything requires evidence.

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.110
It could very likely be Huang Wuchang!

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:39.400
Huang Wuchang just escaped

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.160
from your Secret Investigation Unit.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.350
Then this incident happened immediately.

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.920
The timing matches, right?

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.960
Huang Wuchang hated Constable Zhong
for arresting him,

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.160
so he wanted revenge.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.070
That's a motive, right?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.830
Nonsense.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.960
If Huang Wuchang were there,

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.720
why wouldn't he just

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.510
kill Constable Zhong directly,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.040
instead of killing Old Bug?

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.350
Go back.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.680
Chief Fang, stop making excuses.

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.920
The suspect is a constable
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.200
To avoid any bias,

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:24.840
this case should be handed over

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.820
to the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.690
No way.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.270
How could we allow

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.550
the Secret Investigation Unit

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.440
to forcibly take over our case?

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.980
This case is connected to the Yesha case,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.770
so it should rightfully
be handed over to our unit.

00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:42.550
Whether it's connected to Yesha

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.150
is not proven with evidence.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.270
Don't be so stubborn.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.960
Chief Fang, if you still refuse
to hand over the suspect,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.310
I'll have no choice
but to report to His Majesty

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.350
and let him order you
to hand her over.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.000
The innocent have nothing to fear.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.550
Since I'm a suspect,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.750
I can go to jail

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.890
and give you time to find evidence.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.880
But I'll say it again.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.680
I didn't kill anyone.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.830
Take her away.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.550
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.110
-What?
-What are you doing?

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.790
Stop!

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:32.400
Tong Shuang!

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:33.640
Step back!

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.720
This is the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.400
We have our own rules here.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.350
You have no right to take action.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.610
Everyone, stand down!

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.310
Put it down.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.640
Put it down!

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.690
Everyone, put your weapons down!

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.500
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.790
Why is she still standing here?

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.870
Take her away.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.510
Yes, sir.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.790
Chief Fang,

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.370
are we really letting them take her away?

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:26.690
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.150
Tong Shuang!

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.380
Where is Constable Zhong?

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.790
Old Bug is dead.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.280
Constable Zhong was taken away
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280
Dead?

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.090
Then will Constable Zhong

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.480
be in danger?

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.840
In the hands of those Zhuge

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.590
senior and junior jerks,

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.450
I'm afraid she's in real trouble.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.670
