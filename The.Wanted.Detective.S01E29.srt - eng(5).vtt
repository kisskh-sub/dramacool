[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 29]

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.950
How is my brother?

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.450
He's probably been poisoned.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.640
What kind of poison?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.280
I've never seen this poison before.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.430
This poison is extremely potent.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.360
It seems capable of
making one's vital essence boil.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.990
Can this poison be cured?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.840
Once a person's vital essence
starts boiling,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.280
it may unleash their greatest potential

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.950
for a short time,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.000
but the strain on the body
is overwhelming.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.280
Even martial artists
can barely withstand it,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.800
let alone your brother,
who's just an ordinary man.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.750
His heart and all his meridians

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.800
have ruptured.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.829
Even if we manage to save him,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920
I doubt he'll live for
more than a few days.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.750
W-What do you mean?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.720
Is my brother beyond saving?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.110
What I can do now

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.800
is use my medical skills

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.360
to help him regain
as much clarity of mind as possible.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.280
However...

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.430
However what?

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.430
In his current condition,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.520
even if he wakes up,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.640
he'll only last a few hours at most.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.820
Whether to proceed or not,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.820
I can't make the decision for you.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.430
Mr. Feng.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.850
Please use the needles.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.910
Are you sure?

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.750
At least let him

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.470
leave this world with dignity.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.030
Don't blame yourself too much.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.290
This isn't your fault.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.000
Right now, I just regret

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.750
that back in Poison Valley,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.100
I didn't study properly.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.300
Otherwise, I could have saved his life.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.820
You've already saved many lives.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.840
Without you,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960
who knows how many times
we would have died?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.760
That's right.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.750
All the clues now

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.840
point to poison.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.310
Without you,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.690
we wouldn't feel confident
continuing the investigation either.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.910
Luo Sen is awake.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.280
Brother.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.870
This is the person I told you about,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.399
the one from the Qi Kingdom.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:21.990
Brother...

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.430
I heard about your situation

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.920
from Luo Shu.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.870
Thank you for being willing to save me

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.409
-and my family.
-Don't say that.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.650
This is what we should do.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.970
If you have any questions,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.650
please go ahead.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.600
Mr. Luo.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.600
After you

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.960
arrived in the Lonely Town back then,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.080
what did you do?

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.070
How did you get poisoned?

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.840
We just found

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.510
some supplies for the winter

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.040
in the Lonely Town,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.070
and then we hurried back.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.930
Other than that,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.000
we didn't do anything.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.600
Well,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.830
on your journey,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.800
did you encounter anything strange

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.240
or any suspicious people?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.660
I have a deep impression

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.040
of a certain place.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.040
What place?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.260
The Bei Hai Residence.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.860
The Bei Hai Residence?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.950
The elderly people here

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.430
survived the Haiya massacre.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.590
When I was little,
I asked out of curiosity,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.430
and the elders told me

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.860
that the soul-devouring monster

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.000
in Haiya

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.830
was released by someone

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.600
from the Qi Kingdom

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.040
named Bei Hai.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.920
Beyond that,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.040
they didn't know anything else.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.240
But before they died,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.110
they kept mentioning this name.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.070
Mr. Luo,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.310
do you know where that Bei Hai Residence

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.970
is located in the Lonely Town?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.920
On the west...

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.750
Northwest slope.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.000
On the first

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.680
small hill.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.830
That place

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.270
looks somewhat remote.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.370
Brother.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.760
Shu.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.310
-Shu.
-Brother...

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.360
What did Xing say?

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.600
He said

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.780
he hopes we can come back again.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.480
I told him

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.150
we'll definitely come back.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.360
Will the Qi Kingdom and Haiya

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.000
keep going like this?

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.600
Seeing Haiya become

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.910
like it is now,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.670
I suddenly understand

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.790
why Yesha and the others

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.720
are so determined to seek revenge.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.840
Because this is the only thing

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.320
they could do for Haiya.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.240
Years ago, the Canfeng Army planted

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.790
a seed of hatred in Haiya.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.240
And what Yesha did

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.150
was simply plant

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.910
another seed of hatred in the Qi Kingdom.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.030
An eye for an eye.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:35.390
We may not

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.390
have the ability to resolve hatred,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.910
but what we can do is

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.080
stop more seeds

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.740
from taking root and growing,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.120
at least

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.150
to prevent tragedies

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.870
from repeating themselves before our eyes.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.270
Can we really do that?

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.200
When the truth

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.750
is revealed to the world,

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.270
whether it's the Qi Kingdom or Haiya,

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.320
good and evil will ultimately
find their rightful place.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:58.000
Justice is born from the human heart.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.460
Once there's compassion,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.880
the outcome will change.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.790
I believe

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.610
that day will definitely come.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.600
That day will definitely come.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:09.910
Before it gets dark,

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:10.790
let's pack up

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.320
and head to the Lonely Town.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.270
My goodness.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.200
If it weren't for case investigation,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.330
I would never come to a place like this.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.570
Everyone, stay safe.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.390
Luo Sen said

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.270
the Bei Hai Residence is

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.870
in the deepest part of Haiya.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.180
Let's split up and look around.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.030
If I'm not mistaken,

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.960
this figurine must be

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.030
Bei Hai's wife.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.000
Beiming.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.390
I found

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.720
a really strange place.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.870
This.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.580
A blank tombstone?

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:15.230
Did you find anything?

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.440
We've looked around and found nothing.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.770
We might have come here for nothing today.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.120
Don't you find

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.520
this place somewhat odd?

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.600
It is odd.

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.720
Why is there

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:39.750
a blank tombstone in this courtyard?

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.360
It's not the tombstone that's odd,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.820
but the courtyard itself.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.720
Outside, weeds are everywhere,

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.870
but inside this courtyard,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.400
there's not a single plant.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.890
It is indeed desolate.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.520
Be careful.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.360
What kind of place is this anyway?

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.070
Looks quite old.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.750
This definitely looks like a tomb.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.290
Who would build a tomb

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.580
in their own backyard?

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.000
The character "upper?"

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:38.390
[Upper]

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.510
What does it mean?

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.400
Be careful, everyone.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.790
I feel there's more

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.590
to this place than meets the eye.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.390
Tong Shuang.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:01.780
Let's go.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.220
Careful.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.440
This cave appears to be

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.670
naturally formed.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.320
It's just been converted

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.960
into an underground chamber.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.490
Looks more like a maze to me.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.200
Be careful, everyone.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:25.840
Okay.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:34.510
The ground is slippery here.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.150
Careful.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.620
What kind of insect is this?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.440
Never seen it before.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.200
Must be some kind of bug

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.440
unique to this cave.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.670
I won't use this knife again.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.320
Please throw it away for me, thanks.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.850
Let's keep moving forward.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.480
Here.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.200
Thanks.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.190
Danger!

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:45.840
Run!

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.080
Feng Qingzhuo!

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.740
Throw some insect repellent!

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.720
-The repellent isn't working!
-Let's go!

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.440
Run!

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.510
Quick!

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.360
Quick, light a fire and seal the entrance!

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:58.480
The bugs are coming out!

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.070
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.550
Run!

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:01.100
Run!

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.310
Dairong!

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.460
Catch her!

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.200
Watch out!

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.310
They're afraid of salt!

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.710
Quick, take out all the salt
you have on you!

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.240
Here!

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.680
My Goodness.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.590
We're finally safe.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.000
You almost scared me to death.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.130
You were risking your life back there.

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.680
It was nothing.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.700
How are you feeling?

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.720
-I'm fine.
-Are you okay?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.440
I'm okay.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.880
Just some scratches.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.400
They weren't poisonous.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.680
Can I hold you a bit longer?

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.480
So dramatic.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.780
Don't say that.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.310
Let's go.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.800
The character "middle."

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.400
[Middle]

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.060
The previous one was "Upper."

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.400
Seems there must be a "lower" somewhere.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.240
So that means

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.830
this cave has at least three levels?

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:29.350
Wait,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.790
who exactly is this Bei Hai?

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.000
The rocks in this cave

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.920
must have been here
for at least hundreds of years.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.110
Bei Hai went to so much trouble

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.240
to build this place.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.330
There must be something hidden here.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.830
Those weird bugs we just saw

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.960
are the best protection for this level.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.560
I wonder what else is in here.

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.490
[Middle]

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.580
The guards on this level are bugs.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.340
What will the next level have?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.310
Be careful.

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.310
We'll deal with whatever comes our way.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.790
This should be the only path here.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.320
That must be the Lower Gate.

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:28.510
We don't know

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.640
when this bridge was built.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.480
Be careful.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.050
Let's cross one by one.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.030
The bridge is safe for now.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.030
Everyone be careful when crossing.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.750
It's too dark in here.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.480
I can't see anything at all.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.640
Wait here for me.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.210
I'll go ahead and check.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:47.880
Be careful, Beiming.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.350
Okay.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.090
Tong Shuang, don't!

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.240
It's a trap mechanism!

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:47.880
Run!

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:49.550
-Run!
-Let's go!

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.270
Get back!

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.880
Quick! Get back!

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.590
We have to jump down.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.720
The current is too strong.

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.550
If we jump in,
who knows where the water will carry us?

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.550
What should we do?

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.830
Jump over there!

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.000
Xueman, take Huo Dairong with you.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.200
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.950
Everyone hold tight.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.840
Tong Shuang!

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.000
Tong Shuang!

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.550
Are you okay?

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:50.550
I'm okay!

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.160
Beiming, are you okay?

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.510
Hang in there!

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.790
[Lower]

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.000
The Lower Gate.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.030
Beiming, the Lower Gate!

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:13.090
[Lower]

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.140
Let's go.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.960
Come on.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.290
Why is it so cold in here?

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.960
This is all cold jade.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.040
There's actually
such a large cold jade mine.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.870
This won't do.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.160
If we stay here any longer,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.620
we'll all freeze to death.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.640
The gate! It's closed!

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.330
Step aside. Let me try.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.170
[Lower]

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:04.790
[Lower]

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.460
Xueman, stop wasting your internal energy.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.640
There's a mechanism in this gate.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.610
It seems Bei Hai

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.670
has no intention of letting us leave.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.600
But we don't have any warm clothes.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.310
We can at most hold out here for an hour.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.440
Otherwise, we'll all freeze to death.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.270
Don't panic.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.160
I have a feeling that Bei Hai

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:28.750
is trying to tell us something
through this cave.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.030
What do you mean?

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.150
If Bei Hai didn't want others

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.440
to find what he hid,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.830
he wouldn't have set up three gates

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.310
in vertical order for guidance.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:37.830
Whether it's the weird bugs
on the first level

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.090
or the sword statues on the second level,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:42.070
it all looks like a death trap.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:43.550
But now that I think about

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.920
how we managed to escape,

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.000
it was like Bei Hai

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.510
intentionally left us a way out.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.840
Beiming, you're right.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.640
There must be clues left

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.920
on this level as well.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.550
As long as we find that way out,

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.830
we can escape.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.750
While we still have strength,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.310
let's split up and search.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.000
Alright.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.510
Be careful.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.010
Be careful.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.240
Here,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.160
warm up your hands.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.480
Are you okay?

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.310
I've been poisoned by frost toxin before.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.750
This bit of cold is nothing.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:58.960
Found nothing?

00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.890
Yeah, nothing.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:01.490
Let's stay together for now.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.710
It'll be a bit warmer.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.050
What should we do?

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:05.960
Are we going to die here?

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.900
Xueman.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:23.550
What is this?

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.830
This is...

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.880
Do you recognize it?

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.550
It's the symbol of Poison Valley.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.480
Poison Valley?

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.790
Now I understand.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.350
Everything makes sense now.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.840
What do you understand?

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.110
Bei Hai is a disciple of Poison Valley.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.030
I searched his pharmacy
on the upper level,

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.400
and in his medicine box, I found

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.000
Poison Valley's gold needles.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.830
Poison Valley's gold needles

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.070
are different from regular ones,

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.830
unique in size and dimensions.

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.030
At that time, just based on the needles,

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:59.290
I couldn't be certain.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.070
Only when

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.350
I saw these symbols just now

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.000
did I become certain
that he is from Poison Valley.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:03.720
What do these symbols

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.000
actually mean?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.070
Medicinal herbs.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:08.200
Poison Valley's formulas are top secret.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.510
-To prevent leaks,
-Xueman.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.550
all medicinal herbs in the valley

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.610
are represented by special symbols.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.070
Even if outsiders see the prescriptions,

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.530
they won't understand
the specific contents.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:17.480
Since he could understand these symbols,

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.200
it proves

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.330
he must be a disciple of Poison Valley.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.400
But even if we know these symbols now

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.350
and that he's

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.550
from Poison Valley,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.100
we still can't get out of here.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.240
We can definitely get out,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.500
because I understand now.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.300
I understand his intention now.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.000
You mean

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.920
you cracked the puzzle?

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:38.030
That's right.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:39.440
As long as he's a disciple
of Poison Valley,

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.570
I can be certain that

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.160
where we are now

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.480
is not an ordinary cave,

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.160
but inside Bei Hai's body.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.940
Inside Bei Hai's body?

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.370
What does that mean?

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:51.930
Tong Shuang.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.640
Come on, stand here for me.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.750
Stand here?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.860
Let me explain.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.960
The human body is divided into upper,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.160
middle, and lower regions.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.680
From head to heart is the upper region,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.160
from heart to navel is the middle region,

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.650
and from navel to feet
is the lower region.

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:05.900
This corresponds exactly
to the three gates

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.240
we just passed through.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.910
And the meaning of these three levels

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.100
precisely describes a disease.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.120
[Upper][Middle][Lower]

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.960
The upper region feels like
being bitten by insects,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.510
the middle region feels like
being stabbed by knives,

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.840
and the lower region...

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:16.920
Feels icy cold.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.750
Yes, that's the condition.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.960
Beiming, please.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:33.200
Not it.

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.880
Not it.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.000
Not it.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.350
Still not it.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.400
What exactly

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.810
causes this condition?

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.310
A poison.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.750
It's the signature poison

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.550
of the previous Poison Valley Chief,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:49.680
Separation Powder.

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.240
Is the Poison Valley Chief

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.480
the master of Unstoppable Old Man,

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.610
your grand-master?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.000
How did Bei Hai know about it?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.480
Perhaps because
Bei Hai was poisoned by it before.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.640
I'm beginning to sense

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.960
his true identity.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.440
But what we need to do right now

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.680
is find the exit.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.350
And the way to break the deadlock here

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.590
might be hidden

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.880
in the floor tiles carved with symbols.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.750
Constable Zhong.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.880
You mean

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.920
we need to find the antidote
for the Separation Powder?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.070
In the Yin-Yang Book

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.350
my master left me,

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.190
there's the antidote formula
for this poison.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.400
Two ingredients.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.600
Just two ingredients left.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.270
You can do it.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.670
You definitely can.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.270
Master.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.510
May your spirit in heaven

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.480
bless us.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.270
Could my judgment be wrong?

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.410
It's over there!

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.440
Over there!

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.270
Looks like this gate still won't open.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.590
Are we going

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.350
to die here?

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.400
This...

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.030
This hole

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.350
looks somewhat familiar.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:16.310
This is your dowry.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.550
I've deposited all the deeds

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.750
to our lands and shops

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.680
in the bank.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.590
This thumb ring is the token.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.790
You can retrieve them

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.110
anytime you need.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.650
He gave me this thumb ring yesterday,

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.480
saying it's my dowry.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.750
But it sounded more like
a parting gift.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.590
Master...

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.710
Let's go.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.590
Be careful.
