00:33.625 --> 00:37.875
[crew] Ooh. [laughing]

00:57.250 --> 00:59.167
-[alarm blaring]
-[door opens]

00:59.250 --> 01:01.125
[footsteps approaching]

01:01.917 --> 01:03.958
-[tapping buttons]
-[machine humming]

01:07.167 --> 01:08.250
[Clem] Morrow.

01:09.083 --> 01:10.167
Hey, Morrow, wake up.

01:13.208 --> 01:14.292
Hey.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.708
[machine stops]

01:16.250 --> 01:17.250
What day is it?

01:17.333 --> 01:18.833
Thursday, I think. Hey, listen, we got--

01:18.917 --> 01:20.292
Is it a changeover?

01:20.375 --> 01:23.083
-[Clem] What? No, listen, there's been--
-Why is the alarm on?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.208
That's… Jesus, will you just listen?

01:25.875 --> 01:27.417
There was a fire in containment. Not…

01:28.042 --> 01:31.250
We got it out,
but there was a creature loose. Or two.

01:31.333 --> 01:35.958
Well, not loose. Not, like, missing.
We know they… One is dead, I think.

01:36.042 --> 01:37.125
Hey, it's the other way.

01:37.958 --> 01:39.333
Two of the clam things got out.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.500
You know,
the octopus with the long fingers.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.125
And they got Captain Dinsdale and Bronski.

01:43.708 --> 01:44.833
Captain's dead, but…

01:44.917 --> 01:47.042
Well, you just gotta see.
I got them both in medbay.

01:47.125 --> 01:50.375
Bronski… Zaveri said…
She used the word "compromised."

01:50.458 --> 01:52.042
Hey, which…
She and Bronski are hooked up now.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.833
You slept through that,
like, the last eight months maybe.

01:54.917 --> 01:56.458
Hey, I recorded something,
if you wanna see?

01:56.958 --> 02:01.917
Well, pretty vanilla stuff, but she
likes to be on top, which is sort of hot.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.958
[Zaveri] We need to establish
some sort of protocol.

02:04.042 --> 02:05.958
[Rahim] Listen, darling.
I've been drinking for so long--

02:06.042 --> 02:07.833
-We're--
-A bit of… a bit of tobacco.

02:07.917 --> 02:09.500
[Zaveri] That's not
what this is about, though.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.292
I mean, come on. This is like you're…

02:11.375 --> 02:14.417
-[Rahim] It's always my fault. Always.
-[Zaveri] Yeah, it is. In fact, it is.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.125
[alarm dings, stops]

02:17.708 --> 02:18.750
[Morrow] What happened?

02:19.958 --> 02:22.708
Mr. Morrow, you're in your underwear.

02:22.792 --> 02:24.875
-I said, "What happened?"
-[Rahim] Um…

02:25.625 --> 02:26.625
Captain's dead.

02:27.333 --> 02:28.417
I can see that.

02:29.042 --> 02:30.750
-We, um…
-[Chibuzo] Oh, come on.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.917
Thanks. I…

02:36.042 --> 02:39.833
I tried to remove the creature, but
the grip on his throat was quite tight.

02:39.917 --> 02:43.417
So, I made an incision… [whistles]
…at the base of the tail,

02:43.500 --> 02:45.667
-and he just died.
-They bleed acid.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.833
Clem said there was a fire.

02:47.917 --> 02:52.208
Yes, in the containment room.
Sprinklers came on with the alarm.

02:52.292 --> 02:56.458
Captain Dinsdale got there first,
put it out. Bronski was right behind him.

02:57.708 --> 03:00.292
Two of the containment pods
must have been opened.

03:00.375 --> 03:01.667
And the arthropod's eggs hatched.

03:01.750 --> 03:03.417
-What caused the fire?
-I'm gonna be sick.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.458
-[gags]
-[Morrow] Quiet.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.917
I said, "What caused the fire?"

03:07.000 --> 03:08.375
-[Rahim] Uh…
-We don't know.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.167
[Morrow] But why were the egg crates open?

03:10.250 --> 03:11.250
-[Zaveri] Morrow.
-No.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.375
-I'm assessing the threat.
-[Zaveri] There'll be time for that.

03:15.458 --> 03:18.458
Right now, the captain is dead
and my science officer is compromised.

03:19.875 --> 03:22.333
How do we get it off,
if we can't cut it off?

03:22.417 --> 03:25.083
[Chibuzo] I'll say it again.
The protocols are very clear.

03:25.167 --> 03:28.667
"Any crew member who comes into contact
with alien life forms

03:28.750 --> 03:31.625
are to be placed in cryo-sleep
for the remainder of the journey."

03:31.708 --> 03:35.458
Which is two weeks,
three days, and six hours,

03:36.083 --> 03:38.125
for those of you
not counting the fucking seconds.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.708
So you're saying freeze him

03:39.792 --> 03:42.458
with that thing humping his face
for the rest of the ride?

03:43.708 --> 03:47.125
-What's the status of the other entities?
-Uh…

03:49.792 --> 03:52.458
Chlamydia, you and Chibuzo, go to the zoo

03:52.542 --> 03:54.417
and make sure
the rest of the creatures are secure.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.458
I told you not to call me that, please.

03:56.542 --> 03:59.542
I, um, I want to stay with Bronski.

03:59.625 --> 04:02.667
M-Maybe I can find a way to neutralize
the acid or sedate the creatures--

04:02.750 --> 04:03.750
No.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.083
Morrow's right.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.583
We have to make sure everything else
is locked down,

04:08.667 --> 04:10.792
or our lives are about to get a lot worse.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.542
Where's Teng?

04:12.625 --> 04:14.167
Uh. Mess hall, I think.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.500
[Zaveri] Tell him to help Dr. Rahim
put Mr. Bronski into his tube

04:16.583 --> 04:18.958
and to prep the captain's body
for burial in space.

04:19.625 --> 04:20.833
-[Rahim] Okay.
-Morrow.

04:21.417 --> 04:22.917
Get dressed and meet me on the bridge.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.000
-[clicks]
-[door opens]

04:32.625 --> 04:34.667
[door closes]

04:35.333 --> 04:37.625
Put them both in the air lock
and have done with them.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.083
Is that engineering's official opinion?

04:42.208 --> 04:44.625
What she didn't tell you was that

04:44.708 --> 04:48.042
the fire fried our navigational systems,
and our engine relays.

04:48.708 --> 04:49.708
[Morrow] Meaning?

04:50.292 --> 04:53.625
Meaning, we were a spaceship,
and now we're a missile.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.417
And we're heading towards Earth.

04:58.667 --> 04:59.667
You should fix that.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.792
Yeah, no shit.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.542
-We're gonna be okay, though, right, boss?
-[sighs]

05:11.542 --> 05:12.542
Boss?

05:18.292 --> 05:20.500
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Let me sweep the place first.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.208
And the lights are green.

05:24.417 --> 05:27.167
If containment was broken, they'd be red.

05:27.875 --> 05:28.875
[Clem] Right.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.625
[sucks teeth, sighs]

05:37.125 --> 05:40.333
-[chittering]
-[knocking]

06:00.792 --> 06:03.542
-Incompetence or sabotage?
-[tapping buttons]

06:04.750 --> 06:06.333
Are you asking me or are you telling me?

06:06.417 --> 06:08.625
I'm saying
those are the likeliest scenarios.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.792
Mother runs routine systems checks,
engineers do stress tests.

06:12.875 --> 06:16.292
The random fire breaking out
in an empty containment room

06:16.375 --> 06:19.792
in the exact panel
that controls both navigation and speed.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.500
Bullshit.

06:22.292 --> 06:25.875
[Zaveri] We don't know anything yet.
It could be equipment failure.

06:27.708 --> 06:33.375
You need to call a ship-wide emergency,
so I can start an official inquiry.

06:33.875 --> 06:38.250
Do you know the level of panic if I tell
everyone there is a saboteur on board?

06:39.208 --> 06:40.500
I need to take this to Mother.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.292
You were fucking Bronski.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.042
-[chuckles] What do you--
-[Morrow] Company policy

06:53.125 --> 06:55.833
forbids romantic relationship
between crew members.

06:58.875 --> 07:00.083
How did you know that?

07:00.167 --> 07:03.750
I'm the head of security for this ship.
I know everything.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.750
[sighs]

07:11.167 --> 07:12.167
We just…

07:13.375 --> 07:14.833
You don't ever get lonely out here?

07:15.417 --> 07:16.542
You're distracted.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.708
-Your judgment is compromised.
-Wait a minute.

07:19.792 --> 07:20.958
In the event

07:21.042 --> 07:23.542
the security officer believes
that the acting captain

07:23.625 --> 07:27.250
is not doing everything necessary
to protect this ship,

07:27.792 --> 07:29.542
he may take command himself.

07:29.625 --> 07:32.458
Fuck you. That's mutiny.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.250
I am responsible for the well-being
and safety of my people.

07:35.333 --> 07:39.667
And I am responsible for getting
this cargo back to Earth intact.

07:40.417 --> 07:43.083
Those instructions from the company
are crystal clear.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.958
Whether or not the crew survives.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.250
Fine. Let's go see Mother together.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.333
[chuckles]

07:54.083 --> 07:55.250
You talk to the computer.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.167
My orders are from Yutani herself.

07:59.250 --> 08:05.583
Nothing matters but the cargo.
Not you, not me, not the fucking cat.

08:06.875 --> 08:11.083
So, declare the emergency.
I'll be in security.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.750
[Rahim chuckles] Another victory
for the enemy of reason.

08:26.208 --> 08:27.917
What does that mean?

08:28.833 --> 08:34.750
It means this space bug is proof
of how stupid smart people can be.

08:35.333 --> 08:38.042
Smart enough to build ships
capable of space travel,

08:38.125 --> 08:40.500
of splitting the atom
and decoding the genome,

08:40.583 --> 08:43.250
but too stupid to realize
you don't bring parasites home with you.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.333
Hmm.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.000
He wasn't a good man.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.333
But nobody deserves this.

08:56.083 --> 08:57.708
[Clem] Why do they want
these things anyway?

08:57.792 --> 08:59.250
-Weyland-Yutani?
-Yeah.

08:59.833 --> 09:01.250
Ah, you little rascal.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.250
It's power. It's always about power.

09:05.917 --> 09:08.250
You've got five big corporations
that control everything, right?

09:08.333 --> 09:09.792
But our guys want to be on top.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.958
So, they send us out
to collect the most terrifying shit,

09:13.042 --> 09:15.000
so they can use it to take over. Got it?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.208
-Yeah.
-Yeah, got it?

09:17.292 --> 09:19.542
-Oh.
-Be a nice guy. Thanks.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.667
[speaks in Hebrew]

09:26.208 --> 09:29.042
Come on, Teng. Leave that poor girl alone.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.333
Or I'm gonna call the captain.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.458
Captain's dead.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.542
[chittering]

10:51.167 --> 10:52.667
[electricity crackling]

11:24.208 --> 11:26.167
[engines rumble]

11:56.792 --> 11:58.458
-[tapping buttons]
-[machine humming]

12:05.167 --> 12:07.083
[explosion]

12:10.625 --> 12:11.792
[alarm blares]

12:11.875 --> 12:12.958
[Mother] Fire.

12:15.958 --> 12:17.000
Fire.

12:18.333 --> 12:19.708
[crew member] Fire! Fire!

12:20.208 --> 12:21.208
Fire.

12:24.542 --> 12:25.583
Fire.

12:29.167 --> 12:30.208
Fire.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.292
Fire.

12:37.875 --> 12:38.917
Fire.

12:39.708 --> 12:40.875
Containment breach.

12:42.167 --> 12:43.250
Fire.

12:43.333 --> 12:44.875
-What's going on?
-Don't know, man.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.083
Containment breach.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.375
Containment breach.

12:53.208 --> 12:55.042
-[groaning]
-Hey!

12:55.125 --> 12:56.750
Containment breach.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.708
[grunts]

13:07.125 --> 13:08.750
[taps buttons]

13:14.917 --> 13:16.667
[tapping]

14:01.208 --> 14:02.458
Who are you?

14:10.042 --> 14:11.042
[sniffling]

14:21.500 --> 14:22.750
[sniffling continues]

14:33.917 --> 14:35.042
[moans]

14:36.333 --> 14:38.167
[both moaning, breathing heavily]

14:52.208 --> 14:54.208
[both panting]

15:03.583 --> 15:04.583
Almost home, baby.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.833
[squelching]

15:30.875 --> 15:33.625
I thought we were gonna be
collecting, like, rocks and stuff.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.750
That's what it said on the paper.
A biological survey.

15:37.833 --> 15:38.833
No.

15:39.375 --> 15:43.000
No, geology
is the study of rocks and stuff.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.667
Biology is the study of animals.

15:45.333 --> 15:48.375
Oh, shit. Really?

15:51.583 --> 15:52.625
You sure?

15:53.542 --> 15:54.750
How do you know all of this?

16:03.708 --> 16:05.333
Are you gonna eat that or what?

16:05.417 --> 16:10.333
Yeah. I'm just,
you know, perambulating about it.

16:13.083 --> 16:17.083
Do you know if you were to cut
that pie in half, and save half for later,

16:17.167 --> 16:19.042
then each half will become a whole?

16:19.125 --> 16:20.583
Now you've got two pies.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.875
Wait, no, uh,
how's half a pie a whole pie?

16:25.458 --> 16:27.667
Plus, the last time I did that,
you ate the other half.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.875
I've tried that one already?

16:29.958 --> 16:32.417
Uh, mate, if you want half of my pie,
you've just got to ask.

16:35.042 --> 16:36.125
He's getting around the ship

16:36.208 --> 16:37.917
-without using the halls.
-[Malachite] Who?

16:38.000 --> 16:41.542
I need to see blueprints.
All the crawl spaces and access points.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.708
Wait, what, are you saying
someone set the ship on fire?

16:48.375 --> 16:49.667
Where are you on repairs?

16:50.250 --> 16:53.833
The relays are severed.
Trunk calls need to be replaced.

16:53.917 --> 16:56.167
We're talking days, not hours.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.208
Whoever fucked us
knew exactly where the hole was.

16:58.292 --> 17:00.750
Wait, boss, is he's saying that
somebody broke the ship on purpose?

17:00.833 --> 17:03.208
You say nothing. Either of you.

17:04.125 --> 17:07.208
Failure to comply with a direct order
from your security officer

17:07.292 --> 17:09.292
in the course of a criminal investigation

17:09.375 --> 17:11.833
will result
in a total forfeiture of shares.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.375
Yeah. Just keep it quiet.
That's not a problem.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.500
[Clem] Is it really? I mean…

17:26.708 --> 17:28.917
you saw the footage.
It could be anyone, right?

17:29.917 --> 17:31.833
The sabotage. Even me.

17:32.750 --> 17:33.750
[metal rasps]

17:36.667 --> 17:38.083
Is it you?

17:40.250 --> 17:42.375
No, come on… Come on, I was just…

17:44.250 --> 17:45.833
For example, I'm just saying.

17:49.917 --> 17:50.917
[metal rasps]

17:59.250 --> 18:00.917
Did you pull the communication logs?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.542
I tried, but somebody
deleted all the files, so…

18:04.125 --> 18:05.083
[device whistles, clicks]

18:05.167 --> 18:06.708
…I'm running a recovery program
on them now.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.208
[device whistles, clicks]

18:08.292 --> 18:09.750
Think that'll tell us
who's behind all this?

18:10.833 --> 18:13.792
-[device hums]
-Innocent people don't destroy evidence.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.750
[buttons beeping]

18:46.667 --> 18:49.250
Mother, this is
an official GR30 command change.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.458
Dinsdale, RJ is deceased.

18:53.125 --> 18:56.375
Executive Officer Zoya Zaveri
has taken command.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.875
[tapping buttons]

19:16.292 --> 19:19.833
-[tapping buttons]
-[beeping]

19:50.875 --> 19:52.875
[scoffs] Fuck you.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.083
-[tapping buttons]
-[beeping]

20:09.917 --> 20:11.833
[cat meows]

20:11.917 --> 20:13.708
[♪ "La Mer" playing]

20:34.875 --> 20:36.875
[song continuing]

20:46.875 --> 20:51.250
Sorry, Captain. My bad.
It should've been me.

20:53.708 --> 20:54.708
Not yet.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.458
Uh. No offense.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
[song continuing]

21:14.333 --> 21:15.333
[song continues, echoed]

21:21.667 --> 21:22.667
There.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.625
See that?

21:26.292 --> 21:27.292
I'm going there.

21:28.583 --> 21:33.500
When you miss me or you wanna talk,
just look straight up.

21:34.708 --> 21:37.958
I'll always be there. Looking back at you.

21:39.417 --> 21:41.375
So be good because I'll be watching.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.167
[sighs]

22:38.958 --> 22:41.083
[rumbling]

22:47.542 --> 22:48.542
[Zaveri] Talk to me.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.125
Do you want the public version
or the private one?

22:55.292 --> 22:56.958
Mr. Teng, give us a minute.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.375
Why?

22:58.458 --> 23:01.292
So he can tell you
somebody blew a hole in the ship

23:01.375 --> 23:04.375
after setting fire to our engine controls.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.625
I am not an idiot.

23:12.583 --> 23:14.375
Our saboteur knew just how to hurt us.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.042
Our fuel reserves are down to 8%.

23:18.125 --> 23:22.750
In 24 hours,
the ship turns from missile to arrow.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.500
But I need navigation control.

23:25.583 --> 23:28.042
The kid's welding a new column.
It's gonna take a bit of time.

23:29.458 --> 23:30.750
[bangs on surface]

23:30.833 --> 23:33.458
We need help.
We have to wake up the rest of the crew.

23:33.542 --> 23:39.500
[Mother] Cryopod quarantine breach.
Cryopod quarantine breach.

23:45.583 --> 23:51.500
Cryopod quarantine breach.
Cryopod quarantine breach.

23:53.167 --> 23:54.833
I was in the toilet, ten minutes max.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.250
[Zaveri] It was frozen solid this morning.

23:57.833 --> 23:58.917
[Rahim] Bronski was frozen.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.083
Maybe… Uh, I mean,
you'd have to ask Chibuzo.

24:02.667 --> 24:05.208
But what if you can't freeze these things?

24:05.292 --> 24:09.292
Their metabolism, we know they can
survive in a cold vacuum of space, right?

24:09.375 --> 24:11.083
So maybe their metabolism
doesn't slow like ours.

24:11.167 --> 24:13.000
-Call Chibuzo. I need her to--
-[Morrow] Stop.

24:13.083 --> 24:15.125
It doesn't matter how it happened.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.417
A specimen implanted an embryo.

24:18.167 --> 24:20.250
The embryo hatched,
and now it's loose on the ship.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.417
So we'll wake everybody up,
form search parties.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.500
[Morrow] No.

24:23.583 --> 24:26.875
Ten more people having feelings,
a saboteur on board, creatures loose.

24:27.417 --> 24:29.625
-We don't need the headache.
-So what? We find some nets?

24:30.833 --> 24:32.167
How big can it get?

24:35.500 --> 24:36.500
Wait.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.750
How big do these things get?

24:41.333 --> 24:42.833
You saw the containment room.

24:42.917 --> 24:44.417
If we shoot this thing and it bleeds,

24:44.500 --> 24:46.208
the acid's gonna eat
through the hull of the ship

24:46.292 --> 24:47.708
and we all die.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.292
Electric, nonlethal.

24:51.833 --> 24:53.875
You see it, you pull the trigger
till it hits the floor.

24:54.458 --> 24:56.292
Capture, don't kill.

24:56.833 --> 24:57.833
Clear?

25:39.875 --> 25:44.458
[Chibuzo] Okay. Species 19. Log 82-32.

25:44.542 --> 25:46.833
If the subjects
live off oxygen from blood,

25:46.917 --> 25:50.625
they won't feed on dead animals,
no matter how hungry they get.

26:11.625 --> 26:14.167
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.625
Subjects have been deprived of food
for two weeks.

26:39.375 --> 26:40.583
What keeps you going?

26:41.500 --> 26:42.958
Interesting.

26:43.833 --> 26:49.208
Species19 will feed on dead tissue
if hungry enough.

27:29.958 --> 27:31.958
That's enough out of you.

27:32.583 --> 27:33.583
[gasps]

28:02.708 --> 28:04.417
-[Rahim] Fuck's sake.
-Oh!

28:06.833 --> 28:07.875
Where the fuck…

28:07.958 --> 28:09.208
I-I don't know.

28:10.417 --> 28:11.458
How did you get out?

28:12.208 --> 28:13.208
Careful.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.167
[Rahim] Shi… Fucking bastard.

28:16.583 --> 28:17.583
Went for a stroll.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.083
[Rahim whistles]

28:27.167 --> 28:28.458
You must have left the top open.

28:28.542 --> 28:31.000
No, I… I always--

28:31.083 --> 28:32.500
[Rahim] Always. Yeah.

28:32.583 --> 28:34.250
Zaveri wants everybody
in the mess hall.

28:34.792 --> 28:36.125
Did something happen?

28:40.292 --> 28:41.583
[Rahim] Bronski… [whistles]

28:42.208 --> 28:43.208
…is dead.

28:43.708 --> 28:44.750
Chop-chop.

28:45.417 --> 28:48.625
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

28:54.625 --> 28:56.000
Oh, God.

29:55.375 --> 29:58.208
You haven't tasted the fucking honey.
You don't know what bitter is?

29:58.292 --> 29:59.458
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

29:59.542 --> 30:00.750
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Rahim.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.083
-How are you doing mate?
-I'm good.

30:02.167 --> 30:03.417
-[kisses] You're my favorite.
-Thank you.

30:04.167 --> 30:07.417
I've asked you guys about this.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.875
Teng, you and Rahim and these cigarettes.

30:09.958 --> 30:12.583
-I said, it's not my cigarette.
-Please. I've asked.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.583
-I've asked.
-[Rahim] It's not my fucking cigarette.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.375
-[Teng] Apology.
-[Chibuzo] It's not your place.

30:16.458 --> 30:18.250
-These cigarettes.
-[Rahim] It's not my fault.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.958
[Chibuzo] This is why I eat in the lab.
Just saying.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.042
-All right, settle down.
-Come on, hurry up.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.083
[Zaveri] Now look,

30:28.833 --> 30:30.542
there's no easy way to say this.

30:31.042 --> 30:32.208
Bronski…

30:33.125 --> 30:35.125
We thought the cryopod
would contain the creature,

30:35.208 --> 30:37.667
but it escaped, so he's dead.

30:38.458 --> 30:41.417
-[Chibuzo] Watch it.
-Pardon me, Your Majesty. It happens.

30:41.500 --> 30:42.542
Quiet.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.125
-It's a xenomorph.
-What's a xenomorph?

30:48.208 --> 30:49.375
Still in early stage development,

30:49.458 --> 30:50.458
-but growing fast.
-Dangerous.

30:50.542 --> 30:53.042
Our plan is to sweep the ship and
to recapture it, which is…

30:53.125 --> 30:54.125
-[all chattering]
-Quiet!

30:54.208 --> 30:56.583
-[Rahim] You're a muppet.
-That's company protocol.

30:57.375 --> 31:00.125
-Tell 'em about the fuel.
-[Malachite] Oh, yeah, this is good.

31:00.208 --> 31:01.542
[Zaveri] Thank you, Mr. Teng.

31:02.542 --> 31:04.000
We've had a major fuel breach.

31:04.083 --> 31:08.042
-The tanks blew. We're flying on…
-Fumes.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.333
-Yeah. Yeah, we're flying on fumes.
-What does that mean?

31:11.417 --> 31:14.625
-[Zaveri] That's enough.
-[Chibuzo] You're being so casual about…

31:14.708 --> 31:16.042
[Zaveri] It gets worse.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.458
We have a saboteur on board.

31:18.542 --> 31:20.333
-What's a saboteur? Is that a Frenchman?
-Shut up.

31:20.417 --> 31:22.667
-I'm declaring a ship-wide emergency.
-[Rahim] Bad Frenchman.

31:22.750 --> 31:25.083
All nonduty-related movement is suspended.

31:25.167 --> 31:27.625
-[Rahim] Suspended? That's fucked up.
-She said doody.

31:28.167 --> 31:29.375
[Chibuzo] Okay.

31:29.917 --> 31:31.208
Mr. Malachite.

31:33.917 --> 31:35.417
Wh… Me?

31:35.500 --> 31:37.375
[Zaveri] This is a meeting, not a meal.

31:37.458 --> 31:42.208
Oh. [chuckles] Well,
when life gives you food, eat.

31:42.292 --> 31:43.333
That's what my mum used to say.

31:43.417 --> 31:44.917
-Shut up!
-[Rahim] Bless your mum, mate.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.375
Don't fucking listen. Know what I mean?

31:46.458 --> 31:47.917
-[Malachite] I'm just--
-Sort out your life.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.417
Well, you're saying that
we can't leave our quarters or whatever,

31:50.500 --> 31:52.167
so who knows
when we're next gonna be able to--

31:52.250 --> 31:54.958
One sixteenth share, I'm docking you.
That's official.

31:55.042 --> 31:56.083
-[Rahim] Ooh.
-[Chibuzo] Shit.

31:56.167 --> 31:59.833
-[Shmuel] Stop picking on the kid.
-I didn't… Fuck.

32:00.833 --> 32:03.000
-[Chibuzo] That'll be it.
-[Malachite clears throat]

32:04.875 --> 32:06.333
The fuck is wrong with him?

32:06.417 --> 32:08.292
-[Malachite coughing]
-[Shmuel] You're upsetting him now.

32:08.375 --> 32:09.375
That's cruel.

32:10.292 --> 32:11.375
[Malachite continues coughing]

32:12.333 --> 32:14.000
[Chibuzo] Hey, hey, hey.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.750
That time of the month, darling?

32:15.833 --> 32:17.083
[Malachite] Fuck me, that was hot.

32:23.708 --> 32:25.708
Two people are dead.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.583
We've lost creature containment.

32:29.667 --> 32:30.833
And one of you…

32:32.208 --> 32:33.250
Look around.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.208
One of you is trying to destroy this ship.

32:41.333 --> 32:46.542
I want duty rosters and activity logs
in my hands in one hour.

32:47.292 --> 32:50.708
Interviews of off-duty personnel
will start immediately.

32:51.333 --> 32:53.417
From now on, we travel in pairs.

32:53.500 --> 32:58.000
-Zaveri and I are armed. Clem is armed.
-[Zaveri] Hey.

32:58.083 --> 33:00.750
We don't know who's the fucking monsters
on this fucking ship.

33:00.833 --> 33:03.792
No one else gets a gun until I'm confident

33:03.875 --> 33:05.667
-you're not trying to destroy my ship.
-[all arguing]

33:05.750 --> 33:08.167
-[Rahim] And I'm here like a fucking sod.
-[Chibuzo] Why do we have guns?

33:08.250 --> 33:10.000
-[Rahim] Fuck off--
-Knock it off!

33:11.875 --> 33:13.833
What, you… you want a reward?

33:13.917 --> 33:15.083
[Malachite] Yeah.

33:15.167 --> 33:17.208
Give me information
that leads to an arrest.

33:19.958 --> 33:21.708
I'll make sure you get an extra share.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.625
-[Shmuel] Yeah. Sure it is.
-[Rahim] That's fucked up,

33:27.708 --> 33:29.250
the whole thing here.
Do you know what I mean?

33:29.333 --> 33:31.333
-[Zaveri] Dismissed.
[Shmuel] He's decided, he is.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.375
-Leave it.
-[sighs]

33:33.458 --> 33:35.000
[Malachite] You're not supposed
to waste food.

33:35.083 --> 33:37.167
-Just leave it, okay?
-[Chibuzo] Can you…

33:38.667 --> 33:41.708
[Rahim] Fucking… With no doctor,
you haven't got fuck all, innit?

33:43.333 --> 33:46.625
I'd love a fucking spotted dick now.
It's quite good.

33:46.708 --> 33:50.000
[whispers] It's running on fumes.
What the fuck does that mean?

33:50.083 --> 33:52.542
-[Malachite] Do you want anything?
-[Shmuel] Just grab a snack and fuck off.

33:53.708 --> 33:56.125
[door opens]

33:56.208 --> 33:57.833
Did you sabotage my ship?

33:57.917 --> 33:59.792
What? No.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.500
-Good. Come with me.
-[sighs]

34:02.583 --> 34:03.958
[Zaveri] I need a way to track this thing.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.958
[Mother] Communication file,
recovery in process.

34:10.292 --> 34:12.958
Estimated progress status:

34:16.208 --> 34:17.542
Twelve percent.

34:19.875 --> 34:21.083
[Rahim] Check the work logs.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.417
I was in the medbay that whole morning.

34:25.250 --> 34:26.250
[Morrow] You're sweating.

34:26.750 --> 34:27.792
[Rahim] Bro.

34:28.750 --> 34:33.125
We've been stuck in a metal tube
for 65 years, breathing recycled farts.

34:34.458 --> 34:35.667
How are you not sweating?

34:36.542 --> 34:39.833
Or is that what it's like
to be a part machine?

34:43.375 --> 34:46.333
You've been calling home. Making plans.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.750
Give up the ship, maybe get rich.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.375
What?

34:54.417 --> 34:57.583
The medbay cameras
have a blind spot. I checked.

34:59.250 --> 35:01.958
-You were off screen for ten minutes.
-[scoffs]

35:02.542 --> 35:03.792
I don't know what to tell you.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.083
Your cameras suck.

35:06.167 --> 35:09.042
And if I check the pharmacy,
am I gonna find anything missing?

35:09.125 --> 35:11.583
That's slander. Slander!

35:12.083 --> 35:13.292
I've been sober…

35:14.083 --> 35:15.542
Enough with the fucking…

35:17.500 --> 35:19.917
A long time. Too long maybe.

35:21.083 --> 35:25.667
Considering… [stammers] …the amount
of bullshit I have to put up with

35:25.750 --> 35:27.750
in this company, you know?

35:28.750 --> 35:29.750
You know.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.417
[stammers]

35:48.042 --> 35:49.833
I just wanna go home, man.

36:04.292 --> 36:05.625
What the…

36:14.875 --> 36:15.875
[grunts]

36:17.000 --> 36:18.292
[grunting]

36:20.208 --> 36:21.708
One sixteenth share.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.875
For what? A little bit of lo mein?

36:24.958 --> 36:28.375
You're taking the piss, mate.
I don't even like lo mein very much.

36:29.417 --> 36:30.833
If I had all the money in the world…

36:33.333 --> 36:35.458
bit of pancake, bit of that hoisin stuff.

36:37.583 --> 36:38.583
You're laughing, mate.

36:45.708 --> 36:48.208
What are you gonna do with your shares
when you get back?

36:48.292 --> 36:50.000
Buy your wife something nice, I bet.

36:52.875 --> 36:55.917
Kid, when I left, my wife was 31.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.667
She looks like my grandmother now.

36:59.625 --> 37:01.333
You see, that's
what they're paying you for.

37:01.958 --> 37:03.250
It's not the work,

37:04.292 --> 37:06.708
it's 65 years of your life.

37:07.333 --> 37:09.292
Equals a quarter of a share.

37:10.458 --> 37:13.958
And then you go, "Oh, yes, please, sir.
Send me on another mission."

37:16.167 --> 37:17.708
[grunts]

37:18.500 --> 37:19.917
I think I ate too much.

37:21.917 --> 37:23.542
Pass me that wrench, will you?

37:23.625 --> 37:26.250
-What?
-The wrench. Pass me the wrench.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.750
-All right. Sorry.
-Come on.

37:29.667 --> 37:30.792
[metallic clicking]

37:30.875 --> 37:32.125
Yeah.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.083
Doesn't creep you out
being down here after…

37:37.333 --> 37:38.750
You better not throw up.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.458
Pass me that goddamn wrench. Come on.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.875
-Jesus, you better not--
-[gags]

37:47.958 --> 37:49.292
I swear to God…

37:53.542 --> 37:54.708
Boss.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.000
Kid.

38:01.750 --> 38:02.750
Kid.

38:04.625 --> 38:06.417
Kid. Help!

38:11.042 --> 38:13.250
When we took our first readings
from the xenomorph eggs,

38:13.333 --> 38:16.208
we found elevated levels
of gamma radiation.

38:16.292 --> 38:18.417
I should be able to
rig a Geiger counter to…

38:20.000 --> 38:21.417
Oh, my God.

38:22.417 --> 38:24.625
-What?
-Oh, my God.

38:24.708 --> 38:27.792
-Chibuzo.
-She… She's loose.

38:27.875 --> 38:28.875
Who?

38:31.667 --> 38:32.958
The eye.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.500
[alarm blares]

38:39.125 --> 38:40.792
-[metal clattering]
-[Chibuzo gasps]

38:40.875 --> 38:42.542
-We have to go.
-[whimpers]

38:42.625 --> 38:43.750
Right now.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.542
-[Rahim, on intercom] Captain. Zaveri.
-What is it?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.042
I need you in the medbay.

38:49.125 --> 38:51.083
-Can it wait?
-Not if you want him to live.

38:51.167 --> 38:52.417
[sighs]

38:54.375 --> 38:55.500
-We have to seal the door.
-Yeah.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.875
We'll deal with this later.

39:04.083 --> 39:07.167
[Teng] I was on the bridge
when the fuel pod blew.

39:08.458 --> 39:10.042
Check the nav logs.

39:10.125 --> 39:12.250
[Morrow scoffs] Logs can be forged.

39:16.292 --> 39:17.375
Sure.

39:18.458 --> 39:22.000
And some people say
all this is just a simulation.

39:22.792 --> 39:27.125
But that's not the conversation
we're having.

39:29.958 --> 39:31.375
I checked the feed.

39:32.542 --> 39:35.417
You're still visiting her at night,
aren't you?

39:36.417 --> 39:38.458
Doing your filth while she sleeps.

39:39.583 --> 39:41.958
[exhales slowly]

39:42.042 --> 39:44.375
How are you bypassing the keypad?

39:44.875 --> 39:47.042
Or maybe you're using the vents.

39:47.542 --> 39:51.375
Same way you got into
the containment room and set the fire.

39:54.708 --> 39:56.625
You're missing it.

39:56.708 --> 39:57.708
Tell me.

39:58.625 --> 40:02.500
It's right in front of you,
but you can't see it.

40:02.583 --> 40:03.625
What?

40:05.042 --> 40:10.083
Just because the computer says

40:10.167 --> 40:15.000
a cryopod is full doesn't mean it is…

40:16.000 --> 40:21.667
all the time.

40:27.375 --> 40:29.042
There it is.

40:29.125 --> 40:30.500
Someone else is awake.

40:31.667 --> 40:32.792
Who?

40:48.042 --> 40:50.708
[Mother] Estimated progress status:

40:52.750 --> 40:54.500
Ninety-eight percent.

40:58.458 --> 41:02.750
-Recovery complete.
-[machine beeping]

41:06.875 --> 41:09.250
Resolving recovered files.

41:14.042 --> 41:15.167
[tapping buttons]

41:17.417 --> 41:19.833
-[Clem] Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad--
-[taps buttons]

41:20.333 --> 41:22.708
[Bronski] Hey. Um…

41:22.792 --> 41:24.042
I need to tell you something.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.458
I met this woman on the ship,

41:27.542 --> 41:29.333
-and I think I'm in love.
-[taps buttons]

41:29.417 --> 41:35.125
[Malachite] I am a space engineer's
apprentice, so I mean… [laughs] …come on.

41:36.542 --> 41:39.208
I mean, I'm not entirely sure
what apprentice is, but--

41:39.292 --> 41:43.417
[Shmuel] You'd think bureaucracy
only exists on Earth, wouldn't you?

41:43.500 --> 41:45.375
Oh, no, it's up here too.

41:46.083 --> 41:48.792
The red tape that I have to go through
just to fix something.

41:48.875 --> 41:49.917
[taps buttons]

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
[Petrovitch] I'm tired, bro.
It's too long.

41:53.500 --> 41:56.375
Sixty-five years.
And all the risk that we took.

41:56.458 --> 41:59.458
And the bugs laid eggs in my woman's eyes.

41:59.542 --> 42:02.750
And for what, you know?
A quarter share for a lifetime?

42:03.375 --> 42:06.917
[Boy Kavalier] Yeah, I'm gonna stop you
there because I don't care.

42:07.875 --> 42:11.667
Let me bottom-line this thing.
If the specs you sent are right,

42:12.625 --> 42:13.917
and you can pull this off,

42:15.208 --> 42:16.958
landing the ship in my kingdom,

42:17.917 --> 42:19.250
you're about to be the richest man

42:19.333 --> 42:22.375
in whatever cousin-marrying,
shithole valley you fuck cows in.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.167
[Petrovitch] Yeah, I want a new body.

42:26.167 --> 42:28.375
You can do that now, right, Mr. Kavalier?

42:28.458 --> 42:32.917
Put my mind in a robot
with this, uh, Progeny company you got?

42:33.000 --> 42:37.167
[Boy Kavalier] It's Prodigy. [chuckles]
As in the boy wonder, me.

42:37.667 --> 42:40.250
And yeah. We can do that.

42:41.208 --> 42:42.583
Almost.

42:42.667 --> 42:43.792
You bring me these creatures

42:43.875 --> 42:46.292
and you're gonna go
to the top of the list with a bullet.

42:46.375 --> 42:49.500
[Petrovitch] What if I don't
survive the crash? Hmm?

42:51.667 --> 42:53.125
Well…

42:53.208 --> 42:55.500
Well, that would suck for you,
wouldn't it?

43:53.042 --> 43:54.042
Shit.

44:01.500 --> 44:04.458
[Mother] Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:05.083 --> 44:08.125
Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:08.208 --> 44:11.125
Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:11.833 --> 44:14.667
Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.667
Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:17.750 --> 44:20.458
-Where have you been?
-It's Petrovitch, the saboteur.

44:20.542 --> 44:22.458
He's been pretending to be
in cryo but he's loose.

44:22.542 --> 44:24.917
-I should be out looking for him.
-Kid started puking up blood.

44:25.792 --> 44:27.000
Now he won't wake up.

44:28.333 --> 44:31.292
-So it's a security issue or…
-Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:32.292 --> 44:35.042
Containment threat. Medbay One.

44:36.125 --> 44:37.958
-[intercom beeps]
-Talk to me, Doc.

44:39.208 --> 44:41.750
He's losing blood. We don't know why.

44:41.833 --> 44:43.208
We're scanning now.

44:51.167 --> 44:53.750
See these dark spots up
and down his digestive tract?

44:53.833 --> 44:55.292
They're lining the main artery.

44:55.375 --> 44:58.000
[Chibuzo] I'll get the probe.
We can do an upper GI scan.

44:58.542 --> 44:59.750
[Rahim] No time.

44:59.833 --> 45:02.250
[through intercom] I need to open him up.
Stop the bleeding.

45:06.000 --> 45:07.542
-Do it.
-What if it's contamination?

45:07.625 --> 45:10.542
By the time we put him in the cryopod
and freeze him, he'll be dead.

45:11.958 --> 45:13.750
-Do the surgery.
-[Rahim, through intercom] Okay.

45:18.125 --> 45:20.125
[machine whirring]

45:28.792 --> 45:30.042
Fucking hell.

45:38.875 --> 45:40.500
[Rahim] There'll be ground to make.

45:58.917 --> 46:01.083
[screams]

46:01.167 --> 46:03.250
-[Rahim] Fucking hell.
-[Zaveri, through intercom] Talk to me.

46:03.333 --> 46:07.667
Subject has six foreign bodies
lining his esophagus.

46:07.750 --> 46:09.292
[Chibuzo] It's ticks.

46:09.375 --> 46:10.667
They're ticks.

46:10.750 --> 46:11.917
We need to seal that room.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.292
I'm gonna try to remove one.

46:14.167 --> 46:15.208
No!

46:15.292 --> 46:16.375
Nobody asked you.

46:16.458 --> 46:17.792
They're siphoning too much blood.

46:17.875 --> 46:20.833
You wanna lead? Then lead.
Tell him to stop.

46:20.917 --> 46:22.167
Look, back off.

46:22.250 --> 46:25.417
The lady's the captain. It's her call.

46:25.500 --> 46:26.542
Fuck it.

46:27.875 --> 46:29.083
He's only a kid.

46:29.167 --> 46:30.375
[Rahim] Fucking hell.

46:32.083 --> 46:33.500
-[clears throat, grunts]
-[Chibuzo grunts]

46:34.167 --> 46:35.208
[Rahim] Ready?

46:35.292 --> 46:36.292
It's fucked up.

46:37.458 --> 46:40.250
-Dr. Rahim, what are you doing?
-Saving his fucking life.

46:41.167 --> 46:42.708
[Chibuzo whispers] Gently.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.333
Okay.

46:56.958 --> 46:59.083
[both coughing]

47:02.750 --> 47:04.125
[Morrow] No. No.

47:05.958 --> 47:07.750
Seal it. Seal it!

47:37.750 --> 47:38.958
They're dead.

47:39.958 --> 47:40.958
They're all dead.

48:01.542 --> 48:02.833
It got Teng.

48:02.917 --> 48:04.833
-What got him?
-I don't know. Something big.

48:07.708 --> 48:09.625
Okay. Um…

48:10.542 --> 48:14.375
Okay, we need to get to the bridge,
seal ourselves in.

48:14.875 --> 48:18.208
We got enough fuel to get us
into geosynchronous orbit around Earth,

48:18.292 --> 48:19.750
call in a cleaning team.

48:20.667 --> 48:23.417
We just need to figure out
how to shift our trajectory.

48:23.500 --> 48:26.667
Shmuel, go to the engine room,
transfer all function to the bridge.

48:26.750 --> 48:28.833
Clem and I will wake up
the remaining crew.

48:28.917 --> 48:30.042
Go with Shmuel.

48:33.833 --> 48:34.875
Captain.

48:38.958 --> 48:41.083
I'm taking command of the ship.

48:41.167 --> 48:42.417
Move your ass.

48:48.667 --> 48:50.667
[alarm blaring]

48:51.792 --> 48:53.125
Pistol out and up.

48:55.792 --> 48:58.125
-Wait. Which one is Petrovitch again?
-Just focus.

49:04.958 --> 49:07.458
[whispers] Come. It's gonna be all right.

49:09.167 --> 49:10.583
[sighs]

49:25.708 --> 49:26.792
[Clem] What's wrong with Zaveri?

49:27.667 --> 49:31.000
Remember to use the electric rounds.
We can't afford to hurt the specimens.

49:31.083 --> 49:33.083
Hurt them? What about us?

49:35.208 --> 49:36.458
[gun firing]

50:51.667 --> 50:52.792
It doesn't matter.

50:53.708 --> 50:55.333
You can't stop it.

50:55.958 --> 50:58.292
Stop what? What did you do?

50:59.958 --> 51:02.000
They want their monsters.

51:02.625 --> 51:06.917
Here they come… [grunts]

Where's Morrow?

54:04.083 --> 54:05.167
Shmuel?

54:06.708 --> 54:07.958
We have to seal the door.

54:11.375 --> 54:13.500
Did you hear me? It's coming.

54:51.958 --> 54:54.750
[device buttons buzz]

55:19.250 --> 55:20.250
Zaveri.

55:25.708 --> 55:26.833
Zaveri, get up.

55:26.917 --> 55:28.333
Uh-uh.

55:32.333 --> 55:34.833
[growling, chittering]

55:45.500 --> 55:46.792
Fuck it.

57:00.667 --> 57:02.417
Morrow, let me in!

57:04.375 --> 57:05.875
It's coming.

57:15.792 --> 57:17.667
It's coming!

Fucking asshole!

[song ends]

59:13.125 --> 59:14.792
I'm glad you came in.

59:14.875 --> 59:16.583
No other survivors?

59:17.083 --> 59:19.417
All dead before we hit the ground.

59:19.500 --> 59:21.125
But the cargo survived?

59:22.583 --> 59:23.583
Yes, ma'am.

59:26.167 --> 59:29.958
My grandmother was very fond
of you, you know.

59:30.042 --> 59:31.417
[Morrow] I'm grateful.

59:32.167 --> 59:34.000
She had no reason to take me in.

59:34.583 --> 59:37.833
A feral boy with a palsied arm
begging in the street.

59:37.917 --> 59:40.875

the fiercest thing she had ever seen.

59:41.583 --> 59:44.917

He agreed to arbitration.

59:53.125 --> 59:54.417

59:55.750 --> 59:57.458

59:57.542 --> 01:00:02.042

we're gonna have to do this my way.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.292
Whatever he wants, he gets.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.875
[drumroll]

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:18.375
