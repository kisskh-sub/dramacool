00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.159
Where did this crazy woman come from?

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:08.400
Who are you?

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.040
You want to fight?

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.079
Come on then!

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:14.319
Your Highness,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.400
she is the one I love.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.760
Her?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.560
Exactly.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.280
You have questionable taste!

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.359
Your love?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.079
What does that mean?

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.840
I'll explain later.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:30.959
City Lord,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.840
Moyuan City has long allowed

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:34.640
demons and evil forces to run wild,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560
yet no action has been taken.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.519
I suspect that the Shen family

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.000
might be the true culprit behind it all.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.680
I…

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.079
If Shen Wangchen refuses the marriage,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.239
I will have
the entire Shen family eliminated.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.480
We're leaving.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.400
Your Highness!

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.599
This is all a misunderstanding!

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:52.580
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.480
Get up!

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.439
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.920
Your Highness!

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.439
Your Highness! You can't leave!

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.280
What are you doing?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.319
You started this

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.280
and left

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.479
without a word.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.159
I wrote you letters.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.120
Didn't you see them?

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:13.879
Things got urgent.

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.960
I really had no choice.

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.840
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:16.759
I didn't see them.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.960
I didn't want to.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, I…

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.479
Father, Mother.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.439
She's…

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.520
Dear.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.319
Our son's actually flirting
with this girl.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.560
I saw it.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.199
Darling,

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.960
the Shen family may have an heir now.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.240
You're right.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.680
Daughter-in-law, come home with me.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:45.919
Daughter-in-law?

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.520
Are you talking about me?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.560
I remember now.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.879
Shen Wangchen told me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.199
you're good people.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.479
Allies, right?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.479
Yes.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.879
- Allies?
- Allies?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.879
Yes, allies.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.759
Allies.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.680
Daughter-in-law.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.319
What's your name?

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.680
Fan Dayao.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.520
Da…

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.759
- Fan Dayao?
- Fan Dayao?

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.439
Yes.

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:12.520
Um…

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.840
Father…

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.319
Excellent name!

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.080
You have good taste, sir.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.000
Nonsense.

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.159
You should address him as father.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.000
Darling,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.400
be reasonable.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.840
She hasn't married our son yet.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.319
It wouldn't be appropriate.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.000
Yao,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.039
you can call us

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.120
whatever you like.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.599
Oh, all right.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.159
Sir.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.800
Ma'am.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.560
Good.

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:30.400
Let's go.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.639
You're very handsome, my dear.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.319
Isn't that right?

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.680
You look lovely too, ma'am.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.719
Why didn't Miss Rong come?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.319
Yao,

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.520
this is our home.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.199
This is amazing!

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.400
It's so grand!

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.960
Humans really know

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.000
how to live well.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.319
Humans?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.159
What did she say?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.120
Look!

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.039
All those layers Humans?

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.800
of tiles.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.719
Did you build all of this?

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.560
Father, Mother,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.680
it's because she…

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.879
Looks like Yao has had

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.439
a hard life.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.919
See,

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.479
everything she sees is new to her.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.000
You're right, darling.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.599
She must've had a difficult life.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.240
It's normal she feels out of place
coming into a big household like ours.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.039
We have to treat her well from now on.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:14.680
Yao,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.040
do you like the residence?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.160
Yes!

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.319
If you do,

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.959
consider this your home from now on.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:20.720
Really?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.399
Come on.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.519
I'll take you inside for a look.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.720
Sir, you're generous.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.959
Ma'am, hurry!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.600
You're so slow on your feet.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.480
Oh, this girl…

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.040
Listen up.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.240
Young Madam…

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.879
No.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.279
Her Majesty.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.639
My name is Fan Dayao.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.519
Everyone addresses me as Her Majesty.

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.000
Madam has ordered us

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.560
to learn Her Majesty's preferences

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.439
within two days.

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:44.839
Madam.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.240
I never expected humans

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.279
to have

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.040
so many subordinates as well.

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.560
I…

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:54.519
The fish in the kitchen

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.560
are all gone!

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.040
Report any issues

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.439
immediately.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.120
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.959
Mr. Zhen, what happened to your face?

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:07.560
I'm allergic to cat fur.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.879
We have to look into this.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.040
Come!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.720
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.759
Bad news!

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.920
Her Majesty is trying
to take her own life!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.600
Don't move!

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.560
Her Majesty is trying
to take her own life!

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.399
Quiet!

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:39.000
I've been craving this for a long time.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.279
What?

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.000
I said

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.879
I've been craving this for a long time.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.519
Just this,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.120
and nothing else?

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.439
What else is there?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.959
Never mind.

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:04.839
Rest here in my residence for now.

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:05.800
Tell me whenever

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
you want anything.

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.199
I'm glad I took good care

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.079
of you before.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.490
Glad you remember
that gratitude matters.

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:18.439
Yes, gratitude.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.600
Here.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.480
Thanks.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.279
Dear,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.959
she said

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.120
she once cared for our Chen.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.279
Dear.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.519
I heard you. Lower your voice.

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.279
This woman's behavior is strange.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.000
Doesn't seem like she's from the city.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.439
She is strange.

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:54.839
If she wasn't,

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:56.759
how could she get close to Chen?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.160
But her title sounds

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.920
a bit like…

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.360
Like what?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.279
Like…

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.439
Oh, just tell me!

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.319
Don't tease!

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.079
Spit it out!

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.000
Sounds a bit like a bandit leader.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.839
Well…

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.920
If she were a bandit leader,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.560
why did she take care of Chen

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.120
when he went out gathering herbs?

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.800
What's really going on?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.720
Darling,

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:25.040
you like her, don't you?

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.040
I get along with her.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.600
The more I look, the more I like her.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.639
She's straightforward and honest.

00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:34.439
Chen is usually distant.

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.680
If he can be himself with her,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.720
it must mean he likes her.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720
If Chen likes her,

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.839
then so do I.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.879
No matter what,

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:45.959
since she's with us now,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.759
we should treat her well.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.279
The rest,

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.160
I'll investigate.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.639
I'll follow your lead.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.319
Why did you make me

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.800
wear human clothes?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:05.319
Give me back my battle attire!

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.759
It's because you keep causing trouble

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:09.759
and attracting attention.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.279
Am I?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.439
Mr. Zhen said a woman in red

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:17.360
was hurting people around the city

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:19.079
the other day.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.680
There have been several victims.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.720
Was that you?

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:25.000
They provoked me first.

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.920
You're just like a wild cat.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.960
I trust you wouldn't hurt people
without reason,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.320
but you have to promise me

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:39.879
you won't

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:41.120
cast spells recklessly anymore.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.000
Why?

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.919
Moyuan City is not the Demon Fort.

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:47.519
Your power draws too much attention.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.200
Trust me.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.879
Even if you don't use your powers,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.279
I can protect you.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.870
All of that is trivial
compared to the bigger issue,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.480
which is getting the demon core back.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.759
Wait.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.039
What do you mean?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
You don't know?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.240
Your powers

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.679
come from my demon core.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.519
I know that.

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:19.440
You do?

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:20.799
So what?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.190
Are you planning to keep it
all to yourself?

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.799
I'm fully aware,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.440
and if I don't return

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.279
the demon core,

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:34.639
it will drain my vitality

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.840
until I die.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:43.080
So that's why

00:09:43.879 --> 00:09:45.200
your body is…

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.600
Then what are you waiting for?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.480
Hurry up!

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:52.720
Or you're going to die!

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.759
Wait.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:55.720
Are you saying the demon core

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.759
was given to me

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:58.360
through a kiss?

00:09:58.639 --> 00:09:59.559
Of course.

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:01.000
That's how it was in my dream.

00:10:01.159 --> 00:10:02.000
Clothes off.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.080
Mouth to mouth.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.799
Don't overthink it.

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:08.320
Just do it.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.799
I can't let you die!

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.200
Wait.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.320
Let me try instead.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.000
Close your eyes.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:15.960
Here, here.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.240
Today's Chinese New Year's Eve.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.399
It's Yao's first time celebrating
the Chinese New Year with us.

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.720
Let's drink!

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.559
Thank you, sir.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:22.080
Bottoms up!

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.960
Help yourselves.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.159
Oh…

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:24.759
Fill it up.

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.759
She can really hold her liquor.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.320
Sir,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.600
your liquor is excellent.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:29.290
Much better than what I'm used to
in the mountains.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.039
I've never seen

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.120
a girl drink this well before.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.840
Chen, get some food for Yao.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.840
Yes, Father.

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:36.720
Eat up.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.080
All right.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.960
This is delicious.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.399
All right.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:38.679
Eat more.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:39.240
I won't hold back.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.240
I'll finish everything.

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:41.080
Everyone, look!

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:43.440
That's Young Master's
Chinese New Year's gift!

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.200
Wow!

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.519
What's that?

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:56.399
It's beautiful!

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:57.840
Yao,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.120
have you never celebrated
Chinese New Year's Eve before?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.200
No,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.200
this is my first time.

00:12:02.399 --> 00:12:03.399
It's so beautiful!

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.720
This is so fun!

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.759
Poor girl.

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:15.759
She's never even had
a proper Chinese New Year before.

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:16.519
Yao,

00:12:16.759 --> 00:12:17.960
this is what New Year's looks like.

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.360
Those are fireworks.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.000
Beautiful, aren't they?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.919
Fireworks.

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:24.200
I bet they're powerful enough

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:24.840
to take out

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.159
a few people.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.519
Don't say unlucky things
during the Chinese New Year's Eve!

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:30.399
Oh, all right.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.279
Oh, this girl…

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:33.039
She sure speaks her mind.

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:37.200
Come.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.250
Pour some liquor for the Master.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.240
All right.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:41.679
Here.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.759
What?

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.360
I want to show you

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:46.279
some different fireworks.

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:47.000
There's more?

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.000
These are fireworks too?

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.320
Here, take these.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.559
This is so cool!

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:08.240
