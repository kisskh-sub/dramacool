How's your task going?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.840
Everything is proceeding

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.170
according to your plan.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.479
It's just that

Xiao Beiming...

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.180
Once the fish bites,

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.039
it won't let go easily.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.380
By the time it realizes,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.870
the hook's already stuck.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.980
Continue as planned.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.070
Yes.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.030
Xiao Beiming?

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.800
This game of chess

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.210
is getting more and more interesting.

[Blessings and Longevity]

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.950
When Master was young

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.470
and fighting enemies on the battlefield,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.940
he suffered many injuries

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.630
that left many lasting effects.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.470
In daily life,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.900
he uses these tonics

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.230
to maintain his health.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.190
Miss Huo,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.470
I'm a bit confused by what you said.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.910
You're the only daughter
of the Huo family.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.100
Who in this household could harm you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.590
that it would actually

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.490
make you say "self-protection?"

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.150
You two came from

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.410
the central yard and the west courtyard.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.400
Can't you see

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.680
how rundown the east courtyard is

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.190
by comparison?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.960
I am indeed the only daughter
of the family,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.750
but one no one cares about.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.000
Looks like Madam Feng is awake.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.430
Since she's awake,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.750
may we see her?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.150
Her health is poor.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.470
Now she's been overwhelmed with grief.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.050
I'm afraid...

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.800
It's fine.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.480
My Lords, please wait a moment.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.270
Well?

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.290
Nothing I can tell for now.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.950
We'll need to take all the medicine back

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.160
for testing

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.090
before I can draw any conclusions.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.870
Where is Constable Zhong?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.240
Constable Zhong and Constable Tong

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.560
are questioning someone
in the East Courtyard.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.750
Constable Tong?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.560
You've seen him beforeâ€”

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.390
Tong Shuang.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.190
Let's go.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.490
Take me to see them.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.720
Wait.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.190
I'll grab a few more bottles of medicine.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.040
Better to test more.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.500
I'll take that one too.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.390
Let's go.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.630
This way, please.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.560
Why aren't they here yet?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.190
It's about time.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.050
The effects should be kicking in.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.720
Wait!

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.870
Coroner Feng, what's wrong?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.130
I think I've forgotten

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.960
something.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.190
What is it?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.720
The token of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.870
Would you two mind

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.470
coming back with me to get it?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.130
Let's go.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.920
You can go back by yourself.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.750
This way.

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:55.750
Coroner Feng, are you alright?

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.600
I'm fine.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.750
I'm alright.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.240
Look at me.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.390
I'm so careless.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.830
These are all pieces of evidence.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.070
What should I do?

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.760
I'm almost done here.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.120
Are you...

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.390
Mr. Zhuge,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.760
are you alright?

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.360
Mr. Zhuge,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.870
are you okay?

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.880
Where's the toilet?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.050
I'll take you there!

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.240
It's over there!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.390
Feeling better?

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.120
Hurry up.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.170
You grieve so deeply

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.159
for General Huo.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.400
It seems you two were very close.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.870
Yes.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.480
He took me in as a concubine

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.360
after returning from the battlefield.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.000
It's been 23 years now.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.240
All these years,

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.080
we've treated each other with respect

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.510
and lived in harmony.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.070
Now that he's gone,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.310
my heart

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.560
aches terribly.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160
And that pain

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.000
made my body collapse.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.600
Madam.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.830
My mom

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.090
is very weak right now.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.630
If you

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.159
don't have any more questions,

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:34.870
then...

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:40.630
Madam Feng, Miss Huo, thank you.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.680
Sorry for troubling you for so long.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.000
We should take our leave now.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.070
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.390
Please excuse me for not seeing you out.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.560
Take care, My Lords.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.850
Li Xiao took him to the latrine.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.140
He won't be able to hold him much longer.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.340
You have to leave now.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.920
We'll stall Zhuge Kongyun.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.510
Go now.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.050
We'll meet later

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.110
at Sanli Teahouse.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.360
Constable Tong.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.750
Miss Huo.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.890
Weren't you just

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.170
with Constable Zhong?

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.750
Why are you alone now?

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.390
I have something important to attend to

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.630
at the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.560
Did you follow me here

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.580
because you had something to ask?

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.230
The more I think about it,

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.890
the more I believe
you're not Constable Tong,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.480
but the old acquaintance

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.480
I just mentioned.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.789
Miss Huo,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:33.960
we've never met before.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.360
You must have mistaken me
for someone else.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.150
I have no great talents

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.320
and know little of martial arts,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.360
but when it comes to disguises,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.490
I know a thing or two.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.440
Besides,

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.030
those eyes of yours

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.200
are too familiar to me.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.350
-So...
-Miss Huo, you've got the wrong person.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.600
Long time no see,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.750
Xiao Beiming.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We've met before?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.630
I'm actually a little embarrassed
to admit it,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.480
but I used to

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.150
admire Constable Xiao a lot.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:13.960
I know all the cases you've solved

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.290
like the back of my hand.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.120
I even sneaked to the gate

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.340
of the Elite Constabulary several times

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.180
to watch you.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.700
Since you've

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.060
uncovered my identity,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.870
aren't you afraid I'll silence you?

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.290
I don't believe you're Yesha.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.630
Why?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.000
Because Zhong Xueman

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.600
has always been by your side.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480
You two are quite something,

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.940
coming up with such a plan.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.840
Beiming is indeed impressive.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.600
He was always one step ahead

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.720
of Zhuge Kongyun.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.970
Truly remarkable.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.000
He's coming.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.080
Mr. Zhuge,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.710
what's wrong with you?

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.120
Mr. Zhuge,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.350
what happened to you?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.840
This pill is called
the Taste-Blocking Pill.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.750
After taking it,

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.000
a person's sense of taste and smell

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
will be blocked for an hourâ€”

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.240
they won't be able to detect

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.670
any scent.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.600
It'll make you more comfortable.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.390
This isn't like

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.550
the Five-Blood Pill from last time, is it?

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.670
This pill is a unique formula

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.800
I developed myself.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.440
I wouldn't

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.730
give it to just anyone.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.220
You did this.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.030
Me?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.030
Why do you think so?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.230
That pill...

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.360
Look at me.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.030
I forgot to tell you at the time.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.840
The Taste-Blocking Pill

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.870
does block

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.240
your taste and smell,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.390
but some people

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.680
might experience other symptoms.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.890
What symptoms?

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.430
Non-stop diarrhea.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.390
Come on.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.560
How could you give Mr. Zhuge

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.320
something like this?

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.080
I didn't want to give it to him.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.120
He couldn't stand the smell

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.910
of the autopsy,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.240
so I gave it to him.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.840
It's just an autopsy.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.720
We're all constables.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.320
Exactly.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.440
You can't even handle this?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.030
Right.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.320
And you even need to take medicine?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.000
You...

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.600
You...

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.080
It's alright, Mr. Zhuge.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.810
You'll be fine once the diarrhea
has cleared up.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.670
Once your diarrhea clears up tomorrow,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.130
we can talk about the case.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.320
If there's anyone in the world

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.410
who hates you most and wants to kill you,

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.370
it's her.

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.300
Yet she stays by your side,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.600
taking risks with you.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:09.580
That shows

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.250
you've earned her trust.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:12.960
Since she can do it,

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.240
why can't I?

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.480
You really are smart.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.550
To receive such praise from Constable Xiao

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.870
is a great honor.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.080
However,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:25.910
there's one thing
I still don't understand.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.840
I hope you

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.070
can be honest with me.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.960
Go ahead.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.790
You're now a convicted man.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.840
Why are you so invested

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.970
in my father's case,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.840
even willing to risk your life

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.390
to investigate Huo Mansion?

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.750
There must be a reason.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.670
Could it be

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.830
that my father's case

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.300
is related to Fengbo Lake?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.600
That's right.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.590
We found that General Huo

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.960
is connected to our leads.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.270
But just as we arrived at Huo Mansion,

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.790
General Huo died mysteriously.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.790
It's too coincidental,

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.520
naturally raising suspicion.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.440
But...

00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.960
But my father...

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.680
strangled himself to death.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.000
You said yourself

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.330
that seeing isn't always believing.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.960
My Lord.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:09.730
Someone's coming.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.670
There are guards ahead

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.580
and Zhuge Kongyun behind.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.600
I have a plan. Follow me.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.670
The Huo mother and daughter aren't simple,

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.150
especially Miss Huo.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.060
She speaks with hidden meanings.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.360
Really?

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:33.670
I think she's okay.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.870
I've noticed you always

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.390
defend Miss Huo.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.670
I don't think so.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.670
Why hasn't Beiming returned yet?

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:46.320
Logically,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.390
he left before us

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.790
and should be back by now.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.670
Could something have happened?

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.360
Zhuge Kongyun discovered him?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.760
Young Master, are you feeling better?

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.820
[Huo Mansion]

00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.750
I'm fine now.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.840
Mr. Zhuge, you should go back
and get some rest.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.670
If you need anything,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.800
I'm at your service.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.960
Uncle Wu,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.560
why did you come to clean up at this hour?

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.790
Alright, just go now.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.720
Why are you dressed like this?

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.840
Huo Dairong helped me disguise myself

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.270
to avoid

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.600
being discovered by Zhuge Kongyun.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.360
Huo Dairong?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.270
She?

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.160
She uncovered my identity.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.600
She recognized you

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.100
and helped you escape?

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.320
You two really are old friends,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.030
aren't you?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.940
I really haven't seen her before.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.000
I swear, I truly haven't.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.390
Beiming,

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.960
so why did she help you?

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.250
She asked me to help uncover

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.310
the truth behind her father's death.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.690
Her words aren't trustworthy.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.070
That's right.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.360
The Huo family is complicated.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.790
Huo Dairong is extremely clever

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.840
and hard to read.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.030
But for now, it seems

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.630
she doesn't mean me any harm.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.750
In fact,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.910
she even shared some clues

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.750
about her father's death.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.270
What clues?

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.070
Since you also believe

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.870
there's something suspicious
about General Huo's death,

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.390
I'm sureâ€”given your intelligenceâ€”

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.520
you must already have someone in mind.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.200
Mrs. Huo.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.670
Mrs. Huo?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.520
That's right.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.360
My father had a bad temper,

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.630
but he had never laid a hand on anyone.

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.750
Yet six months ago,

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.680
he suddenly started acting strangely.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.160
He became increasingly violent

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.870
and would lash out

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.970
at the slightest displeasure.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.780
As for my mom's illness...

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.880
rather than saying she fell ill
from grief,

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.270
it's more accurate to say

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.320
she was worn down by my father's abuse.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.120
Then why do you suspect Mrs. Huo?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.360
I consulted a physician.

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.390
If someone were of sound mind,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.550
they would never treat

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.280
their own family that cruelly.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.670
So I suspect

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.480
my father was poisoned.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.480
Everything he ate, wore, or usedâ€”

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.720
including his medicineâ€”

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.080
was managed by Mrs. Huo.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.210
She's the most likely suspect.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.750
But it's only a suspicionâ€”

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.870
I have no proof.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.790
That's why I want to investigate.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.750
Huo Dairong said

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.870
Mrs. Huo was taken as General Huo's
second wife

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.840
five years ago,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.200
when she was just 16.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.820
What about his first wife?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:32.920
His first wife

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.120
passed away five years ago

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.270
without leaving any children.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.200
That day, when I observed Mrs. Huo,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.510
I noticed her behavior was flippantâ€”

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.960
not at all like a refined lady
from a noble family.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.160
Huo Dairong also said

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.480
Mrs. Huo's father and brother

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.910
run a weapons workshop.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.440
After she married into the family,

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.530
that workshop became

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.790
a designated supplier for the military.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.910
Exchanging his own daughter's happiness

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.720
for wealth and statusâ€”

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.700
that's quite

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:55.840
a profitable deal.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.000
Whether there was a deal
behind the scenes,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.240
Miss Huo isn't sure.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:58.930
She only said that

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:00.360
after Mrs. Huo married into the family,

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.390
she was never happy.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.510
She was gloomy all day,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.320
shut herself in,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.510
and spoke to no one.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.200
It wasn't until three years ago
that she seemed to get better

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.790
and began to smile a little.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.200
Three years ago?

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.960
Huo Dairong harbors deep resentment

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.910
toward Mrs. Huo.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.440
We can't judge

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.870
based on her words alone.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.390
We still need to find a way

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.320
to meet Mrs. Huo

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.200
ourselves.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.680
This Miss Huo is hard to figure out.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.510
You'd best not show up

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.870
in Huo Mansion again.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.080
If it really was Mrs. Huo,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.120
then General Huo's death

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.790
likely has nothing to do with Yesha.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.910
The fact that General Huo died

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.650
just as we arrived to investigate

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:35.870
might really be a coincidence.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:36.790
Either way,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.380
let's get to the bottom of it first.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.720
General Huo's death

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.660
was caused by long-term use

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.120
of hallucinogenic drugs.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:42.960
So the suspect

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.690
must be someone in Huo Mansion.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.560
But there's one thing

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.870
I don't understand.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.020
It seems to have no connection

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.410
to Yesha, Xiao Beiming.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:53.510
Exactly.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.870
Maybe there never was a connection.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.840
Yun,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.790
we made a solemn pledge

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.270
to His Majesty.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.510
We can't afford to be stubborn

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.270
and waste time.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.880
But I feel like

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.270
Xiao Beiming is right beside us.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.710
Do you have any evidence?

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.310
Not yet.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.589
But Father,

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.240
please give me a few more days.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.680
Maybe

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.880
by solving General Huo's case,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.079
we can uncover its connection to Yesha.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.440
But if we can't catch Xiao Beiming,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.750
even if we solve

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.720
100 cases,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.920
it won't help.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.109
If His Majesty blames us,

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:30.370
neither of us can bear the consequences.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.590
But right now,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.930
there are no other leads.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.310
Let's take a gamble.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.680
Why hasn't anyone returned yet?

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.760
Could anything have gone wrong?

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.240
Look.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.270
The Huo family is still in mourning.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.270
Why is Xue Qianshan

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.270
out at this time?

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:19.960
Let's go check.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.830
I'll go with you.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.630
Coroner Feng,

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.680
you go back and check the medicines.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.750
Don't follow too closely.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.080
It'll raise suspicion.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.550
That guy's sneakyâ€”

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.310
clearly up to no good.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.510
Let's go.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.200
This place is hidden away,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.310
with high walls

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.930
and guards at the entrance.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.620
Something's definitely off.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.350
From my past experience

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:39.410
investigating cases in the capital,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.350
this could very well

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.880
be an illegal gambling den.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.440
An illegal gambling den?

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.000
Unlike the official
gambling houses outside,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:46.770
which are

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.960
regulated

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:48.960
and keep records

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.160
of all gamblers,

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.640
these illegal gambling den

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.880
operate without oversight

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.960
and with much higher stakes.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.350
Seems like Xue Qianshan
not only likes to gamble,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.160
but he also plays for big stakes.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.680
That's strange thenâ€”

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.070
how could he afford to go to such a place

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.590
with his salary

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:03.880
as a disciple?

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.490
Where does he get the money?

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.810
Someone's coming.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.110
Give it back.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.510
Okay.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.640
Bring another 500 taels of silver,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.040
and I'll return it to you.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.160
That voice sounds familiar.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.440
You're just returning it to me.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.300
Why do you want another 500 taels?

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.270
What's the problem?

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.550
-The entire Huo family fortune
-It's him.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.790
is in your hands.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.620
It's more than just 500 taels.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.440
You...

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.400
Let me play a few rounds.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.880
Keep an eye on Xue Qianshan,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:05.550
and I'll follow that guy.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:06.590
Let's meet at Dingfeng Pavilion.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.430
Be careful.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.110
Constable Zhong.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.570
What are you doing here?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.700
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

[Yuyan Rouge Shop]

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.380
Are you tailing Xue Qianshan?

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.400
On my way to Huo Mansion,

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400
I ran into Xue Qianshan.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.930
He refused visitors today,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.860
so I wanted to see what he was up to.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.270
I see.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.270
Wait.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.070
You went to Huo Mansion alone

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.960
without telling me?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.400
Are you trying to act alone again?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.130
Didn't you have a stomach ache?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:26.790
No, wait.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.750
You wanted to go to Huo Mansion too,
right?

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.750
You didn't tell me either.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:30.350
Well, I...

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.160
Why is he, a man,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.550
buying rouge?

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.480
You're asking me?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.200
You dress like this every day

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.590
and smell really nice.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.200
Shouldn't you know best?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.270
Be serious when investigating cases.

This is the perfume powder.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:05.170
10 taels of silver.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.920
Just a tiny box of perfume powder

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.070
costs ten taels?

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:12.160
This perfume powder is called Beauty Snow,

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.450
made from century-old agarwood

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.640
and Western orchids.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.720
Extremely precious.

Don't tell me

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.210
you don't even know about this.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.920
How would I know about this?

I don't use it.

But you, a man,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.600
sure know quite a bit.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920
As a constable,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.400
one should know a little about everything.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.400
It seems

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.070
you're not quite qualified,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.030
whether as a woman

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.300
or a constable.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.400
Mr. Zhuge, you didn't spend

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.160
those 10 taels of silver

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.490
just to mock me, did you?

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.190
It's for the case, of course.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.790
That rough brute Xue Qianshan

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.720
probably wouldn't use

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.070
such precious perfume himself.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.870
That's right.

I think I smelled this scent

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.200
on someone

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.550
from Huo Mansion.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.830
I smelled it too,

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:07.650
during yesterday's interrogation.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.720
Could we be talking about

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.160
the same person?

Speed is crucial in battle.

something else to do?

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.960

Don't you feel like

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:35.550
you've changed

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.030
recently?

What?

You're not as cynical as before,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.670
your brow isn't as furrowed,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.000
and especially, the murderous look

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.550
in your eyes is gone.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:48.920
But your sharp, sarcastic way

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.790
of teasing me

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.640
is just like it was three years ago.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.880
Such a short time,

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.270
yet such a big change.

Constable Zhong,

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.000
Could it be that you've encountered

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.330
somethingâ€¦ or someoneâ€¦

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.240
who makes you happy?

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.930
I've always been like this.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.750
It's just that
we haven't communicated much,

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.280
so you don't really know me.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.110
Is that so?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.640
I don't want to chat.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.920
I'm heading to Huo Mansion now.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.380
Come if you want, or don't.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.750
Constable Zhong?

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.830
Mr. Zhuge?

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.920
What brings you here so late?

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.000
Miss Huo,

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.200
we've discovered a crucial lead

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.640
in General Huo's case.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.510
Time is of the essence,

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.000
so we had no choice
but to visit you this late.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.240
I apologize

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:44.310
for disturbing you.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.440
What discovery could possibly be so urgent

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.240
that you had to come at this hour?

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.760
Miss Huo, do you recognize this?

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.070
It's Beauty Snow.

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.030
Is this Beauty Snow

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.920
something you

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.310
usually use?

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.320
Yes, I do use it.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.310
You didn't buy it.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.570
Someone gave it to you.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:12.550
Do I need someone else

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.000
to give me cosmetics?

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.730
I checked with the steward

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.340
and reviewed your monthly allowance.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:20.400
It turns out the Huo family
has very strict standards

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.070
for food, clothing, and daily expenses,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.200
especially for you.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.640
With your allowance,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.400
I doubt you could afford

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.240
such an expensive cosmetic.

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.960
Even if this Beauty Snow

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.880
was a gift,

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.830
so what?

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.960
Today, we noticed

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.750
Xue Qianshan acting suspiciously.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.000
We followed him and found that

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.550
he bought this Beauty Snow.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.350
It's a rare luxuryâ€”

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.780
only a few jars are available

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:44.240
in the capital each month.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.920
Unless we're mistaken,

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.920
this one

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.810
was gifted to you by Xue Qianshan.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.220
What exactly is the relationship

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.640
between you two?

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:54.720
This Xishi Snow

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.640
was indeed given to me by Xue Qianshan.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.270
But there's nothing

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:58.550
between us.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.780
It's completely impossible

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.000
for me to have any relationship with him.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.440
He's been pestering me.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.350
I accepted it

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.190
only because

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.750
I didn't want to make things ugly
between us.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.750
Is that a problem?

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:09.880
Not at all.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.440
Since Xue Qianshan

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.790
has feelings for you,

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.880
would you

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.400
be willing to help us?

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.640
Help you?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.350
With what?

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.110
Beiming.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.160
Thank you.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.400
It's getting windy tonight.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.730
Let me close the window.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.030
I need some fresh air.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.370
I'll be with you.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.960
This swill cart is so heavy.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.160
How am I supposed to push it by myself?

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:02.830
But you can't just

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.070
leave it in the middle of the road.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:05.270
It's pitch dark out here.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.350
If someone runs into it

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.400
and gets splashed with filth,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.510
-it'll be a real mess.
-Alright, alright.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.640
Officers, since you think

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.070
the cart's in the way,

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.750
then do me a favor

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.990
and help move it.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.450
Don't worry,

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.110
I won't ask for your help for nothing.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.920
I'll pay you.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:20.200
You...

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.590
What do you mean?

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.590
The Elite Constabulary Unit

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.450
isn't what it was three years ago.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.160
You should take whatever extra money
you can get.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.270
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:31.440
You're pushing it!

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.240
Tong Shuang.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.200
Ifâ€”

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.030
I mean ifâ€”

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.590
if your mistake

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.160
caused people close to you

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.270
to suffer,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.200
what would you think? What would you do?

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.240
You're

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.070
the only one I have left.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.520
We're

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.000
thick as thieves.

00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.880
If I make a mistake

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.350
and drag you down with me,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.670
you wouldn't blame me, right?

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.880
Of course not.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:10.480
I...

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.680
I mean what if it was someone else?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.830
A stranger, even?

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.760
If it's someone else,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.790
then of course you should make it right.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:19.590
Make it right?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.860
Think about it.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.160
If your house caught fire

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:23.800
and accidentally

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.070
burned down someone else's house,

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.680
you can't just

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.240
stand there and watch them

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.440
sleep on the street, right?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.000
You'd have to do whatever it takes

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.330
to rebuild their house.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.030
Senior, are we really going to move this?

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:34.830
Hurry up.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.510
Don't cause trouble for the neighbors.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160
Thank you for your trouble, officers.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.070
Thank you.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.400
Beiming,

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.680
did I say something wrong again?

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.200
No.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.370
You said it perfectly.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.440
Thank you.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:11.370
[Huo Mansion]

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.510
Dairong?

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.080
What brings you here?

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.070
I was restless

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.510
and just wandering around.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.350
I didn't expect

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.790
to end up here.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.640
Seems like you're

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:43.720
facing some trouble.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.240
Tell me about it.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.230
I'll help you sort it out.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.620
My father passed suddenly

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.780
without arranging a marriage for me.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.200
As you know,

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:57.400
Mrs. Huo

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.050
has never accepted me

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.400
or my mother.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400
Now,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.440
my mother and I

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:07.590
don't know who we can rely on.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.440
Those tears come so easily.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.960
This Miss Huo is quite something.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.750
Dairong, don't worry.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.070
As long as I'm here,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.550
I won't let you suffer any injustice.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.240
Thank you for your kindness.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:32.640
However,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.650
women's

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.160
daily expenses

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.510
have always been high.

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:39.920
I know

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:41.510
your monthly salary.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.240
I'm afraid

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.160
supporting my mother and me

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.690
would be difficult for you.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.480
How could I

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.400
burden you like that?

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.360
You're overthinking it.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:53.350
I've been lucky lately

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.750
and found a way to make money.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.970
I even earned a good amount todayâ€”

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.160
this much.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.240
50 taels?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.720
500 taels.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.510
There will be more income in the future.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:08.240
How do you make money?

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.400
I'm afraid money earned by luck

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.330
isn't reliable.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.160
I have a treasure.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.000
Using it to make money

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.640
couldn't be more secure.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:20.510
A treasure?

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.120
What treasure could be worth so much?

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.640
The treasure itself isn't valuable,

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:27.080
but it can bring me

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.180
a lot of money.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.790
Dairong,

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.640
as long as you're willing to be with me,

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.000
I promise you'll live

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.240
a life of glory from now on.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.550
Really?

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.370
I don't believe it.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:43.240
Are you deceiving me?

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.840
Dairong, you don't trust me?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.890
I'll go get the treasure

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.540
right now

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:51.830
and show it to you.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.080
Wait for me, Dairong.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.660
He didn't tell you what the treasure was?

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.400
Where did he go to get it?

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.720
He's been gone so long.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.750
Murder! Murder!

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.380
Coroner Feng?

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440
Why are you here?

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.160
What exactly

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.350
happened just now?

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.750
What's going on?

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.640
Snap out of it!

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.790
Why do you have a knife in your hand?

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.440
A knife?

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.110
He's dead.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.710
How did Xue Qianshan die?

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.550
I didn't kill him.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.000
I don't know.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.110
I didn't kill anyone.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.550
I didn't kill anyone.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.050
Stop him!

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.050
I didn't kill him!

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.030
Take the murderer away!

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.750
Wait!

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.070
The matter hasn't been investigated yet.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.360
What else is there to investigate?

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.960
Do you want to see the entire Huo family

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.960
wiped out before you're satisfied?

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.760
Mrs. Huo,

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.820
we're the last ones

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.920
who want to see another murder
in Huo Mansion.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.360
I know Coroner Feng.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.710
He wouldn't even

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.710
kill a chicken.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.760
How could he possibly kill a person?

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.110
There's something off about it.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:31.800
Give me some time
to investigate thoroughly.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.000
Don't arrest the wrong person.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.800
Are you

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:35.760
trying to cover for him?

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.960
Of course not,

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.800
but we also won't convict anyone
without solid evidence.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.590
There are still

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:45.670
many suspicious points

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:46.480
in this case.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.440
The knife was in his hand.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.800
The victim died at his feet.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.280
What more is there to doubt?

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.679
Do you investigate cases

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.280
by just talking?

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.550
Mr. Zhuge,

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.530
words alone aren't proof.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.570
Actually, it's not complicated.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.230
There were no signs

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.630
of a struggle at the scene.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:02.710
And Xue Qianshan

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.110
was stabbed in the chest,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.360
which means he was facing the killer

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.030
when it happened.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.070
Xue Qianshan was highly skilled
in martial arts.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:11.070
For the killer to take him down
with a single blow,

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:11.800
they must

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.800
have either been

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.800
a master themselves

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:15.510
or...

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:16.510
Or someone

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.840
he knew

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.960
well enough

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.840
to catch him

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.800
off guard.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.980
Coroner Feng and Xue Qianshan

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.860
weren't close.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.800
Do you think

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.480
he would ambush him?

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:27.440
Maybe

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.230
he's a martial arts master.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.550
What kind of master

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.920
sits dumbfounded on the ground

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.070
after killing someone,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.730
letting you

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.360
catch him so easily?

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:34.960
Shut up.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.050
You have no right to speak here.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.880
Miss Huo is right.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.280
Most importantly,

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360
Coroner Feng has no reason

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.400
to kill Xue Qianshan.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.320
Who knows?

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.320
Anyway,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.730
we can't just let him go.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.320
Coroner Feng

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.550
is a member
of our Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.810
Even if he is a suspect,

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.670
he must be handed over

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.400
to the Elite Constabulary Unit
for proper handling.

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.670
He's unconscious now.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.320
Please allow me

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.480
to take him back.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.920
But you're all in this together.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.800
Mrs. Huo,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.770
please don't make baseless accusations.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.910
I'll say it one last time.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.760
Hand him over.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.710
Senior Li,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.550
let me remind you:

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.190
The case isn't solved yet.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.360
Using torture without authorization
is a serious crime.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.690
The Huo family has already had

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.630
enough trouble lately.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:21.150
You...

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.530
Take him away.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.670
Thank you.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.990
We'll take Coroner Feng back

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.230
for questioning

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.000
and give the Huo family an answer.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.930
But until the matter is cleared up,

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:46.960
I ask that no one

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.280
leave Huo Mansion.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.670
As for the body,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.530
the Secret Investigation Unit
will keep it for now.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:05.240
Thank you, Miss Huo,

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.360
for speaking up just now.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.160
It's nothing.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.110
I never expected

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.880
something like this would happen.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.710
What do you plan to do with him?

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.800
We'll interrogate him
according to the law.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.550
Don't worry.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.310
We'll get to the bottom of it.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.880
Thank you then.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.360
I'll head back now.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.550
Take Coroner Feng back with you.

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:35.210
I'll go back and find someone
to handle the body.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.110
You're not staying to question him?

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.210
This case isn't complicated.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.480
There's nothing much to question.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.960
Besides, didn't you say it yourself?

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.440
The killer is either a martial arts master

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.500
or someone familiar to Xue Qianshan.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:45.960
Questioning him won't help.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.560
Did you discover something?

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.110
Coroner Feng ruined this day.

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:54.280
I'm tired.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:55.650
I'm going back to rest.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.150
But you...

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.710
Don't worry.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:57.480
I'll come back

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.590
first thing tomorrow morning.
