[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.920
[Episode 16]

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.710
They're not done talking yet?

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.070
I couldn't hear what they were saying,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.200
but Feng was getting pretty worked up.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:55.690
Let's eat first.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.200
I've told you everything

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.400
about your master.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.710
What are you going to do now?

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.120
In the Yesha case,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.480
the red crystal used by
Chu Guangsha and Huo Zongyao

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.560
was made by you.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.950
What's your connection

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.350
to those people in Haiya?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.910
I can tell you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.970
everything I know,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.850
but you have to let me go.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.360
Don't even dream about that.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.190
I can give you the Yin-Yang Book,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.079
but until the Yesha case is solved,

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.750
there's no way we're letting you go.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.280
Then just kill me.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.250
Once I'm dead,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.980
you'll have your revenge,

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.960
but everything you want to know

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.260
will probably remain a mystery forever.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.150
Come eat now.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.430
Beiming,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.360
I let Old Bug go.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.650
You let him go?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:48.910
Why did you do that?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.280
Are you crazy?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.150
He's connected to Yesha,

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.710
and you just let him go.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.840
What about Beiming?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.070
It's precisely because
he's connected to Yesha

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.520
that I let him go.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.910
Did Old Bug blackmail you

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.640
with information about Yesha?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.610
I can tell you something.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.930
I've seen Yesha.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.560
So,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.800
do you dare to make this deal?

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.280
Once you let him go,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.079
it'll be hard to catch him again.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.329
What about avenging your master's death?

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.130
Making Old Bug pay for his crimes

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:32.710
was indeed

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.170
what I wanted most before.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.620
But now,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.710
compared to avenging my master's death,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.970
some people and things

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.160
are more important.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.300
What's your relationship with Yesha?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.079
Actually, I don't have much
of a relationship with him.

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.070
If anything,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.150
it's just employer and employee.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.750
Why are you here?

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.770
There's a new assignment.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.620
He found me

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.780
and asked me to create a poison for him.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.150
You know,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.430
I'm most interested in this kind of thing.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.470
You know him?

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.680
No, I don't.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.120
Didn't you say you'd met him?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.450
He had his face covered.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.810
I couldn't see what he really looked like.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.950
I'm sorry.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.270
But Old Bug

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.190
still provided us with some clues

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.360
about Yesha.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.870
Although he covered his face,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.600
he looked like a young man.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.950
And

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.310
on the right side of his eye,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.560
there's a black mole.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.870
Would this

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.310
be of any help to you?

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.360
Did he say he was a young man?

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.070
Zhu Yitie said he was an old man.

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.159
Qing Ying said he was always by her side.

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.120
And Old Bug said

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.360
he was a young man.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.870
How many Yeshas are there?

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.120
The only clue

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.750
we have now is that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.950
Yesha has a mole near his eye.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.000
But the Qi Kingdom is so vast.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.070
Looking for someone with a mole

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.800
would take forever!

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.440
What else did Old Bug say?

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.680
The red crystal.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.390
He came to me

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.430
and asked me to create a poison for him.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.750
He wanted something

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.820
that wouldn't be easily detected

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.490
and with long-term use,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.040
it would cause hallucinations

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.310
until death.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.160
After much consideration,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.160
I decided only the red crystal
would be suitable.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.190
The Yin-Yang Book

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.850
does mention the red crystal,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.300
but it never documents how to make it.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.600
How did you learn to make it?

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.720
Both your master and I

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.630
know how to create the red crystal,

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.070
but it is not recorded
in the Yin-Yang Book.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.360
Because your hypocritical master

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.000
secretly deleted it.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.830
At that time, your master thought

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.510
that the process of making
the red crystal was too cruel

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.720
and didn't want this method

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.920
to spread throughout the world.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.950
Fortunately, I remember it.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.360
Otherwise,

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.040
such a valuable thing

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.340
would have been lost forever.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.430
What exactly is the red crystal?

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.520
Well, the red crystal

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.120
is made from a rare mineral

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.480
called red obsidian

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.750
through special methods

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.070
of refinement.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.240
Finding the red obsidian isn't difficult.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.370
The difficult thing

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
is to find the medicinal usher.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.680
What is it?

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.550
Even a tiny amount of red crystal

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.800
requires large amounts of corpse oil

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.950
and living blood to refine.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.360
Corpse oil and living blood?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.630
I told Yesha about the ingredients

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.159
and the refinement method.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.800
I never expected

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.120
that he would actually make it.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.550
Yesha really surprised me!

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.360
You'd never believe

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.560
how many people he killed
to refine that much red crystal.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.630
I can't believe
there's such a cruel method

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.680
of refining poison.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.430
No matter how many Yeshas there are now,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.090
whether they're old or young,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.950
we must

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.120
catch them as soon as possible.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.870
Otherwise more

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.000
innocent people will die needlessly.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.360
Old Bug just

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.600
mentioned another clue.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.360
What?

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.750
The red obsidian.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.360
Since the red obsidian is rare,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.560
there can't be many sources.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.160
We can start our investigation there.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.310
That shouldn't be difficult.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.360
I'll go look into it now.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.270
Be careful.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.070
Let's eat first.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.440
Little White Dragon.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.720
You have something else to say,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.980
something meant for my ears only, right?

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.920
There's something

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.090
I didn't tell Constable Zhong
and the others.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.000
My illness?

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.390
How did you know?

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.760
Actually, the Fire Cicada can't detoxify

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.760
the Blood-freezing Frost poison.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.830
Right?

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.720
There is no antidote

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.310
to the poison in Xiao Beiming at all.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.470
No antidote?

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.600
Impossible!

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.420
You're lying to me!

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.950
You fool!

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.680
Do you really think

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.540
that fighting poison with poison

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.270
could cure him?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.270
That could only stimulate

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.240
the tiny bit of vitality

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.390
he had left.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.720
If you don't believe me,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.080
go check his arm.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.750
There must be

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.200
a livid streak of blood.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.360
That's because the poison

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.390
has already entered

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.870
his meridians.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.360
That livid streak of blood

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.750
will gradually darken and spread.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.550
Once it turns black

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.200
and covers his entire arm,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.360
he will be dead.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.390
He has a month to live at most.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.390
Why?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.080
You're lying.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.790
I'm not lying.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.910
Think about it carefully.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.970
Your master
devoted his life to detoxification,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.690
but actually developed

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.550
Blood-freezing Frost,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.720
a poison that even I

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.200
have never heard of.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.080
Do you really think

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.480
the Fire Cicada

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.120
can detoxify this kind of poison?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.650
You're really underestimating your master.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.000
Actually, he might not necessarily die.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.360
Give me the Yin-Yang Book

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.790
and let me go.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.360
I'll go back and study it properly.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:38.720
I might find an antidote

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.550
before he dies.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.120
But I've already gone through

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.970
the Yin-Yang Book many times.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.000
If it were useful,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.660
I would have used it already.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.450
That's because you're stupid.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.390
With your talent,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.550
even if you memorized

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.550
the whole Yin-Yang Book,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.550
you'd grasp

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.350
barely a fraction of its wisdom.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.440
That book would be a waste

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.870
in your hands.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.550
But I'm different from you.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.000
Even if you can develop an antidote,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.660
I won't let you go that easily.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.910
Who knows if you'll

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.840
reveal Beiming's

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.960
whereabouts?

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.030
I promise

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.270
I won't tell anyone

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.720
about his whereabouts.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.200
Though I've created poisons
and done evil deeds,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.790
in the martial world,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.670
I value my word above all.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.790
How about it?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.550
Dare to take that bet?

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.460
You let go of Old Bug,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.750
saying it was for the clues of Yesha,

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.150
but in fact, it was for me.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.460
Even if I couldn't get

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.770
any clues about Yesha,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.120
you and Constable Zhong

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.440
could still find them out.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.750
How could I possibly

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.200
let him go

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.660
without your permission?

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.610
The Blood-freezing Frost poison

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.000
is more severe than I imagined.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.030
One month left...

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.360
Beiming.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:00.360
I'm sorry.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.390
I'm sorry.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.720
I shouldn't have wasted time
looking for the Fire Cicada,

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.510
taking up so much of your time.

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:10.480
I'm sorry.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.720
Don't say that.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.030
If you hadn't desperately
searched for the Fire Cicada,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.320
I probably wouldn't even have

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:15.910
this one month left.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.720
You've given me

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.910
dozens of extra days to live.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.910
But I still couldn't cure you.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.790
All right.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.630
Little White Dragon.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.950
Little White Dragon.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.150
I should be thanking you.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.390
You desperately searched for
an antidote for me,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.550
and kept it secret,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.960
without telling

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.880
Xueman and Tong Shuang about this.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.870
If those two

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.670
found out,

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.910
they wouldn't care about any cases

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.750
or Yesha anymore.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.350
They'd just hover around me.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.480
You only have one month left,

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.740
and you still want to investigate cases?

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.080
I remember you once told me

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.620
that you are a coroner,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.080
and even with a knife at your throat,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.450
you would never put down

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.750
your autopsy knife.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.570
Do you remember

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.770
the first time we met?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.030
Everyone thinks

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.000
you're the Little White Dragon
from the Poison Valley

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.330
who uses poison to kill.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.200
But only you know

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.510
that you're just a healer who can't bear

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.270
to watch others die
without trying to save them.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.130
Everyone in the world

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.360
thinks I am Yesha.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.270
But only I know

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.600
I'm just a constable

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.360
trying to uncover the truth.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.790
Even if I die,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.480
I'll die on the path of justice.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.390
This is my life.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.130
It's all right.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:29.410
It's all right.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.880
Beiming, Coroner Feng.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:32.960
What is it?

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:35.430
I've found the clue
about the red obsidian.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:36.910
Let's go.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.270
It's Weizhou again?

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.070
That's right.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.220
The red obsidian can only be found

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.510
in Weizhou throughout the Qi Kingdom.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.440
There's a red obsidian mine there,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.910
but the yield is extremely low.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.480
If the red crystal is truly refined

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.120
from the red obsidian,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.320
then going to Weizhou

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.450
will surely lead to clues about Yesha.

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.080
Previously, a large sum of money

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.910
from Chu Guangsha's accounts

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.370
also flowed into Weizhou.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.240
We should definitely go to Weizhou.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.080
Then let's pack up

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.480
and get going right away.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.600
Tong Shuang?

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.700
What's wrong with him?

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.310
I'll take you to Weizhou.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.360
I'm from Weizhou.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.320
You're from Weizhou?

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.960
You've never mentioned

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.360
anything about your hometown before.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.160
That's right.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.600
You must have been away from home
for a long time, right?

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.550
This time you can go back

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.680
and see your family.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.120
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want to.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.120
It's fine.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.320
Since we're already on the subject,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.050
there's nothing I can't share.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.000
I'm the Third Young Master

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.480
of the Pingyuan Escort Agency in Weizhou.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.360
Pingyuan Escort Agency?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.360
I know that escort agency.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360
Weren't they...

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:49.870
Yes,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.160
they were wiped out.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.910
I'm so sorry.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:54.440
I didn't mean to

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.670
make you recall those painful memories.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.740
It's all right.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.510
It's been a long time.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.810
So how did you

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.910
and Beiming meet?

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.510
I knew if my enemies

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.270
discovered I was still alive,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.270
I would certainly be killed.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:11.790
So I fled from Weizhou

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.440
and wandered around the world.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.720
Unfortunately I was captured
by a heartless trafficker

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.270
who sold me

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.530
to the border regions.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.990
I suffered terribly there.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.910
Luckily, I met Beiming later.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.480
So from then on,

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.840
I've been following him,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840
and he has also become

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.910
my only family.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.030
During those three years I was on the run,

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.720
officials and bounty hunters

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.750
were all looking for me.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.410
If it weren't for Tong Shuang,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.440
I would hardly be able

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.770
to stand before you now.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.960
During those three years, to protect me,

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.710
he got many scars on his body.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.910
That's all in the past.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.510
Look at us now!

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:47.750
Aren't we doing just fine?

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.480
Right?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.840
After you left Weizhou,

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.240
you haven't been back, right?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.320
This is a good opportunity to return

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.120
and pay respects to your family.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.270
Right, let's get going now.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.910
Taking the main road to Weizhou

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.240
will take several days at least.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.270
Let's pack up now.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.320
No, this journey is important.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.390
We need to be fully prepared.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.670
There's no need to rush.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:07.390
I...

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.080
I just fear that prolonged delay
may bring unexpected troubles.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.200
True, but we need to

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.440
pack our luggage first.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.000
Let's leave early tomorrow morning.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.790
Xueman,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.670
you, Feng Qingzhuo, and Tong Shuang

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.360
are all official constables
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.750
If you want to leave the capital,

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.360
you need a legitimate reason.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.120
Otherwise you'll be charged with

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.550
dereliction of duty.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.200
I've thought of a way

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.360
to get to Weizhou.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.840
The Elite Constabulary Unit ordered

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.910
ten batches of horses from the frontier.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:36.750
These horses

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.630
developed a disease
when they reached Weizhou.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.120
Dozens of horses are stranded in Weizhou,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120
and the Elite Constabulary Unit needs to

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.870
send someone to bring them back.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.120
What are you suggesting?

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.360
We can volunteer ourselves.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.620

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.510

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.360

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.080
Right.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.320
I have absolutely no problem with that.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.360
But this is

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.910
a dirty and exhausting task.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.790
Everyone in the Elite Constabulary Unit
is trying to avoid it.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.000
If you volunteer,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:58.750
Fang Tianzheng

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.550
might become suspicious of you.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.910
I...

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.630

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:10.120
is so fat and strong.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:11.550
It looks great.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.670
Come on.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.590
Call it "Flat-headed General".

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.480
Alright.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.120
Flat-headed General's cricket

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.030
is really impressive.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.830
Are you happy?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.270

None of your business.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.040
Are you determined to

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:04.920
completely disgrace

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.579

Yeah.

Someone did warn me before,

but that person

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.160

The killer vanished, and we got nothing.

We just handed everything over

from a serious illness,
