00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.640
Stop right there!

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.120
Are you crazy?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.580
Watch where you're going!

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.000
Behave!

[Tea]

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.430
I was chasing a criminal

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.560
and knocked over your tea stall.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.470
Sorry, miss.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.460
I'll take all your tea leaves.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.440
I'll just take these.

[Episode 7]

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.620
After I finish this pot of tea,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.000
I'll go with you.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.900
Have a seat.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.070
Green tea from Nanyue.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.470
Good eye.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.280
Hibiscus brought it back from Nanyue.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.910
Did you commit

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.460
all these murders

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.610
to avenge Hibiscus?

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.680
If it weren't for Hibiscus,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.520
I'd never have
used sewing murder again,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.720
and you never would've seen through me.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.120
And you, Xiao Beiming,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.120
would remain

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.130
the evil Yesha who killed his own master.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.270
Was Hibiscus your wife?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.500
Hibiscus was from Nanyue.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.850
She only knew me as a constable.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.510
I first met her

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.870
when I was working on a case

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.830
at Nanren Lane.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
After that,

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.680
I couldn't get her out of my mind.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.950
Later,

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.370
I went back to Nanren Lane to find her.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.950
She told me

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.090
that the first time she saw me,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.990
she believed I was a good man.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.600
Later, we got married.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.040
We had no family in this world.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.710
Only heaven and earth witnessed our union.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.920
Those were

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.520
the happiest days of my life.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.680
From then on,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.900
I didn't want to kill anymore.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.830
I just wanted to be

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.150
an ordinary constable,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.190
Hibiscus's husband,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.030
and a father to our child.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.480
When I was with her,

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.390
all my pain seemed to disappear.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.620
I even forgot that these hands of mine

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.310
were once covered in blood.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.620
But unexpectedly,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.700
two months ago,

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.000
when I was out on a case...

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.000
It was all Ajia's fault.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.040
He forced me into it.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.920
Take her back.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.630
Ajia,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.510
Hu Shisan,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.040
Marquis Jingshan, and those four bitches

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.270
killed my wife and child.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.130
I had to make them pay with their lives.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.190
So,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.430
I turned back

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.000
into that cold-blooded killer.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.040
Fortunately,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.130
three years had passed,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.800
but I hadn't lost my touch.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.240
You had 10,000 ways

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240
to kill them.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.750
Why choose sewing murder?

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:13.550
Because sewing murder

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.210
is the most painful way to die.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.820
I had to make sure

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.920
they suffered the cruelest punishment.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.820
I never cared

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.440
whether it'd cost me my life.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.560
It was Hibiscus

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.190
and my unborn child

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.270
that made me want to live.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:34.750
I know you two

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.500
must have many questions.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:38.430
Three years ago,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.480
you lost everything

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.630
overnight.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.050
I never knew before

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.580
what that feeling was like.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.750
Now I finally understand

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:47.920
that kind of pain.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.720
Go ahead and ask.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.390
I'll tell you

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.450
everything I know.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.450
The Fengbo Lake case from three years ago—

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.680
was it your doing?

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.240
Yes.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.600
Did you kill my father too?

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.190
I personally sewed
and murdered Zhong Yunchi.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.920
It's such fine green tea.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:28.800
It'd be a shame not to finish it.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.870
Why did you do it?

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.600
It was Yesha's order.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.630
You'll hide in advance

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.240
and kill them

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:45.190
after they lose consciousness.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.120
Yes, Master.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.600
That day, I hid beneath the deck

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.750
for a long time.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.840
I only came out
after everything went quiet

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.840
on the ship.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.120
When I got in the cabin,

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:55.910
I found those five people

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:57.640
had been drugged unconscious—

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.080
completely unable to move.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.910
So I had no trouble at all

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.840
sewing and killing them one by one.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.040
Then why didn't you kill me?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.790
Yesha ordered me

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.600
to spare your life.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.390
There's one more thing you must remember:

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.030
don't kill everyone;

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.630
leave Xiao Beiming alive.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.240
Who is Yesha?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.960
If I told you

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.970
I never saw him, would you believe me?

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.910
How did he give you orders?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.600
And how did he contact you?

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.670
He had 10,000 ways to find me.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.720
He was an extraordinary genius.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:32.720
However, every time we met,

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.960
he concealed his face.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.360
The Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues
three years ago—

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.960
although I carried it out,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.390
the entire murder process

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.120
was designed by him alone.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.240
Not just anyone…

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.800
can come up with such a foolproof plan.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.840
Then is this person male or female,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.570
old or young?

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.440
You must have some idea.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.160
Judging from his build, voice,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.390
and posture,

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.550
he should have been

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.440
a middle-aged man.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.480
A middle-aged man?

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.870
But he might be dead already.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.480
What do you mean?

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.600
That day,

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.430
when I was hiding under the deck,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.670
I vaguely heard

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.600
what sounded like his voice above.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.510
Everyone here

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:13.960
is a suspect,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.550
but only one can be Yesha.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.670
What I've seen today

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.090
has confirmed

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.270
my speculation.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.270
Minister Miao, what are you trying to say?

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.550
Mr. Miao,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:25.440
don't push this

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.440
to a point of no return.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.000
However, I couldn't tell

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.200
exactly who he was.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.030
If he really was

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.480
on that ship,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.730
he might have been killed by me.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.360
How is that possible?

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.600
Why would Yesha send someone

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.550
to kill himself?

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.750
He never did things

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.510
the way others would.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.900
So nothing he did

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.150
surprised me.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.210
So after the Fengbo Lake case,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.360
you never saw him again?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.840
That day, Yesha gave me two orders.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.270
The first was to kill.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.630
Second…

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.080
Once it's done,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.080
infiltrate the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.670
and track down Shen Bi.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.050
Rest assured, Master.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.550
Once I find him,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.960
I'll kill him.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.240
Later, I managed

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.840
to join the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.080
but I never found

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.440
any trace of Shen Bi.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.440
I heard that after the Fengbo Lake case,

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.240
he retired and left the capital.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.270
Most likely,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.550
the Secret Investigation Unit
is hiding him.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.210
After that,

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.440
I never saw him again,

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.740
nor did I

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.770
receive any more orders from Yesha.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.120
Could Yesha really be dead?

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.350
I've told you everything I know.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.600
Let's go.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.870
By the way,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.530
there's one thing

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.660
I forgot to tell you.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.150
Do you know the true meaning

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.440
of the word "Yesha"?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.400
Are you talking about

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.030
Haiya?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.600
Haiya?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.030
Zhong Yunchi,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.790
when will you stop pretending?

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.080
[Fengbo Lake, three years ago]

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.130
King Zhong of Constables

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.840
always handles cases by the book

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.440
and never crosses the line.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:32.370
Yet today,

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.600
without any evidence,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.910
you lured us onto this ship

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.600
into a death trap.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.150
Is this really

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.790
how the King of Constables
usually solves crimes?

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.320
You're clearly trying

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.120
to silence us forever.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:44.600
You...

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.360
Your plan is to kill us first

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.720
and then accuse one of us

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.810
on the ship

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.080
of being Yesha.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.630
You can say the others

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.930
died unfortunately

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.210
while fighting Yesha.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.440
Then you can walk away clean.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.030
Constable Xiao,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.320
why did your master insist

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.600
you not board this ship?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600
Because you were never

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.080
part of his plan!

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.600
Am I right,

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:08.960
Zhong Yunchi, King of Constables?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.550
Or should I call you

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.600
Yesha?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.240
Nonsense!

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.960
My master invited you to the ship

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.390
just to find out who Yesha is.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.670
He has never thought of framing

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.790
or harming anyone!

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.910
Mr. Miao,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.160
don't push this

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.200
to a point of no return.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:31.550
What exactly do you know?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.000
So you've found something

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.860
in the past three years after all.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.080
I'm from Haiya—

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.790
one of the few survivors.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.790
An orphan of Haiya.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.670
Where is Haiya?

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.880
What really happened back then?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.970
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.960
Let me tell you one more story.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.480
What story?

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.080
What are you trying to say?

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.390
Calm down.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.440
You'll understand when I finish.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.600
Long ago,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.390
on the border of the Qi Kingdom,

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.960
there was a small city

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.120
called Haiya.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.870
It was isolated

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:07.870
and sparsely populated,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.550
with fewer than 10,000 residents.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.600
But they lived

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.060
in peace and contentment.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.720
Then one day,

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.120
something strange happened in Haiya.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.030
A horde of monstrous creatures

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.510
invaded Haiya.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.030
These demons

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.550
were vicious, brutal,

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.510
and immune to blades, fire, and water.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.550
In just one night,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.120
they slaughtered all the citizens.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.270
From then on, Haiya disappeared

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.720
from the map of the Qi Kingdom,

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.790
becoming nothing but a folk legend.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.720
You're rambling on and on.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.480
What are you trying to say?

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.840
"Yesha" is actually a name

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.810
given to the demons

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.270
who slaughtered everyone
in Haiya back then.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.120
A small frontier city,

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.480
slaughtered in a single night.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.250
Sometimes, humans can be more evil

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.630
than ghosts.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.510
You're saying it was done by humans?

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.390
In fact, there are no ghosts
in this world.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.050
It was all done by human hands.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.720
Not only did they massacre the city,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.550
but they also found a scapegoat,

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.720
claiming Yesha

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.250
was the vengeful ghost
that destroyed Haiya.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.270
But let me tell you the truth:

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.870
every single survivor

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.870
of that massacre is Yesha.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.480
As long as there's one survivor

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.840
still breathing,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.200
Yesha

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.790
will keep coming back.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.670
That includes you, Xiao Beiming.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.670
King Zhong of Constables,

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:35.720
I suppose Constable Xiao has no idea

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.000
that you've always known

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.870
what Yesha really means.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:39.910
Have you never told him

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.830
the truth because

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.720
you don't want him to know

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.980
what you did years ago?

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.390
Yesha, confess now!

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.150
Do you want me to continue?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.010
What do you mean?

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.480
Do you think capturing me

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.240
will clear your name?

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.360
As Hibiscus's husband,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.480
my wish has been fulfilled.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.940
But as someone from Haiya,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.880
there's one last thing I can do.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.870
Where is Haiya?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.510
What really happened back then?

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.720
Once I die,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.390
you'll still be Yesha.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.030
You'll have to

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.720
keep walking down this path.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.750
The further you go, the darker it gets,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.670
until you fall into an endless abyss.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.200
You'll become just like
the ghost who slaughtered Haiya

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.510
and never go to the afterlife.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.790
Zhu Yitie. Zhu Yitie!

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.240
Zhu Yitie!

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.480
Wait,

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.790
how could you bury Constable Zhu

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.190
together with Hibiscus?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.320
Constable Zhu was Tailor,

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.030
the killer.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.230
You should've taken his body

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:01.030
to the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.670
Only then can his name be cleared.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.870
Zhu Yitie is dead,

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.400
and dead men tell no tales.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.270
With only us testifying for Beiming,

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.170
who'd believe us?

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.240
Wouldn't the wounds on Zhu Yitie

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.310
be proof enough?

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.240
People will only think

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.440
I was the one

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.970
who sewed and murdered him.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.270
But your name

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.829
still hasn't been cleared.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.400
At least you believe me now,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.109
don't you?

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.400
Yes, I've believed you all along.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.590
C-Constable Zhong…

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.920
Dad,

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.720
what is it?

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:23.510
Your dowry.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.240
I've deposited all the deeds

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.440
to our lands and shops

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.550
in a bank.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:32.680
This thumb ring is the token.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:33.510
Dad,

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.680
why are you giving me this now?

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.480
After I get married,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.960
we'll still live together.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.200
It doesn't matter
whether you keep it or I do.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.000
Silly girl,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.660
just take it when I tell you to.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.720
A girl

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.830
needs money

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.480
to have confidence.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.030
Beiming,

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.210
are you worried about Dad?

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.160
I can't shake the feeling
that something's off.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
Off how?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.480
I've worked with Master for years.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.110
No matter how brutal the criminal

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.440
or how dangerous the situation,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.240
he was always calm and composed.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.510
But the look on his face yesterday…

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.970
I had never seen it before.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.480
He looked like

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.480
he was saying his goodbyes.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.360
Now that you mention it,

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.640
I also feel

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.100
something's off with Dad.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.010
Yesterday,

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.470
he gave me this thumb ring,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.880
calling it a dowry.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.480
But it felt more like
he was entrusting it to me.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.640
Do you think my dad…

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.200
could be Yesha?

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.340
Zhu Yitie said

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.200
Yesha was on the ship at that time.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.910
And the order given to him

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.000
was to keep you alive.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.960
I remember it clearly.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.070
That day, Dad kept

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.720
trying to stop you from boarding the ship.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.920
And after boarding,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.560
who else could have been

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:01.590
merciful enough

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.540
to spare your life

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.510
except my dad?

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.020
That's exactly what I've been trying

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.240
to uncover for the past three years.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.440
Back then, on the ship at Fengbo Lake,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.700
before I passed out...

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:15.480
Yesha, confess now!

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.050
At that moment,

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:17.550
I saw Master's eyes.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.960
I had never seen him like that before.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.440
So angry,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.310
so frenzied,

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:23.510
and so out of control.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.770
I was just about to stop him,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.310
and then I blacked out.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.830
You've suspected my dad

00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:32.160
all along, haven't you?

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.920
I've always wanted to prove

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.380
that Master wasn't Yesha.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.790
After I escaped three years ago,

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.350
the only clue I had left to find Yesha

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:41.750
was Haiya.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.590
Haiya really does

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.640
exist.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.070
I don't know exactly where it is,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.960
and I'm afraid no one does.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.400
All I've heard is that Haiya

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.550
is somewhere near the border.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.310
Miao Jie mentioned Haiya,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.680
and judging from Master's reaction,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.400
he clearly knew about it too.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:00.750
If Yesha

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.410
was truly connected to Haiya,

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.590
then finding Haiya

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.440
could uncover clues about him

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.350
and prove once and for all

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.990
whether Master was Yesha.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.680
But I advise you to stop searching.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.400
Why?

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.480
Because even if you find it,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.590
it won't matter.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.790
Sir,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.120
what do you mean by that?

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.590
Everyone there died long ago.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.790
For these three years,

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:24.400
I went through

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.330
all available documents and maps.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.270
But none of them

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.510
mentioned Haiya.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:30.310
Miao Jie said

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.200
Haiya was a border town.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.910
So during these three years,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.000
I searched all along
the Qi Kingdom border.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.840
Legend says

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.550
demons once appeared in Haiya,

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.350
and everyone in the city

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.310
was slaughtered

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.350
in a single night.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.310
Even government troops were alarmed.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.480
They told us demons were coming

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.750
and we should stay inside for a few days.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.780
But nothing happened afterward.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.310
So many years have passed,

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.750
but still, no one dares search for Haiya.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.720
Sir,

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.110
do you know

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.590
when all this happened?

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.680
The 36th year of Ningtai.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.100
I did manage to find

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.510
the general direction of Haiya,

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:08.920
but that whole region is mountainous—

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.920
I couldn't find the exact location.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.070
From Zhu Yitie's confession,

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.960
we can deduce

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.440
that everything Yesha did

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.110
was to avenge Haiya.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.310
We just don't know

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:20.740
what those assassination victims

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.330

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.160
But you...

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.620
My safety doesn't matter.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.780
If three years ago,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.960
the Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.480
was Yesha's revenge

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.030
against high-ranking officials,

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:34.550
then Mr. Shen, who's still alive,

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.720
must know what happened

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.350
in Haiya back then.

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:38.080
Mr. Shen retired and went home,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.680
and hasn't been heard from since.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.070
The Secret Investigation Unit.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.720
But this is too dangerous.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.270
They all think you're Yesha.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.470
If they discover you,

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.200
you'll be

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.330
in constant danger.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:49.400
That's right.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.440
You still have
the frost toxin in your body.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.960
That's precisely

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.240
why I have to do this.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.480
Xueman,

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.400
I don't have much time left.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:06.000
He just vanished without a trace.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.640
Father,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.680
knowing Xiao Beiming as I do,

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.250
I find it hard to believe

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.460
that the Yesha case

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.270
would end this way.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.720
The problem is how to report this
to His Majesty.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.350
Chief,

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.240
Young Master.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.880
Ye…

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.100
Yesha has appeared again.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.440
A servant at the Shen Mansion found it

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.000
and instantly reported it
to the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.260
Did he leave any clues?

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:38.520
He came and went like a ghost,

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.550
[Shen Mansion]

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.010
leaving no traces behind.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.790
Any casualties at the Shen Mansion?

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:43.640
None so far.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.590
[Yesha]

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.030
Li Long,

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.000
take your men

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.600
to Chunyu Town immediately.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.240
Yes.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:58.680
[Yesha]

00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.310
Wait.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:00.440
Father,

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.720
it may be a trap.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.590
Whether it's a trap or not doesn't matter.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:04.400
What matters is

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.600
that we must ensure nothing goes wrong.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.160
Once you reach Chunyu Town,

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.420
escort Mr. Shen
to the safe house at once.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:10.920
Yes.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.240
You guys,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:13.040
come with me.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.680
[Yesha]

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.400
My Lord,

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.860
Zhu Yitie betrayed you.

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.520
He deserved worse than death.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.480
It's just a pity

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.310
that he didn't die by our hands.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.790
Blinded by love.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.550
But he was

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.040
of no value to us anymore.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.930
I'm just afraid

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.480
he revealed something before he died.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.570
That's alright.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.000
It's better if he told

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.720
everything he knew.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:44.070
If Xiao Beiming insists
on seeing the truth,

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.790
then we'll lead him

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.350
and show him the truth.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.440
Let the entire Qi Kingdom

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.160
see the truth!

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.480
Success or failure; survival or ruin;
blessing or curse.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.160
That's the way of all times.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.350
One must hold to the fundamentals,

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.550
stay true to oneself,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.590
and remain humble and restrained.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.800
That's the art of ruling.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.340
[Shen Bi]

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.160
Mr. Shen.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.750
Mr. Shen, are you all right?

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:24.480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.960
I'm completely unharmed.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.480
Sir,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.970
there's a man on horseback outside

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:30.970
asking to see you.

00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:47.200
Greetings, Mr. Shen. I'm Li Long
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.920
Mr. Shen,

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.910
I have urgent matters to report.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.880
I have long retired

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.480
and hold no official position.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.270
Now,

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.270
I'm just an ordinary teacher.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.110
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.870
You have to stay in the safe house
for a few days.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.110
Here?

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.920
You still haven't

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.180
caught this Yesha after all these years?

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.550
I've been hiding away

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:14.200
in the remote countryside,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.550
and now I have to be locked up here

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.720
like a prisoner?

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.880
Unbelievable!

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.310
You guys stay here

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.240
to make sure

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.310
Mr. Shen stays safe.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.490
That damned Xiao Beiming

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:36.110
is so cunning.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.270
Father, don't worry.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.970
As long as he's still alive,

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.170
I'll capture him with my own hands.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.600
But there's one thing

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.530
I still don't understand.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.400
Why did he show up

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.350
this time?

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.520
What's wrong?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.400
Oh, no.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.060
I need to go to Chunyu Town myself.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.390
Young Master.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.680
Is Mr. Shen safe?

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.240
He's in the safe house. All is well.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.640
Mr. Shen.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:44.310
Mr…

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.070
I followed the Secret Investigation Unit

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:09.070
to Chunyu Town

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:09.510
and found Mr. Shen

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.720
in a place

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.550
with lots of children.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.400
That's a school.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.070
Yes, that's right, a school.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.600
Later, they took Mr. Shen

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.030
to a small house.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.400
That house was surrounded by mountains.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.830
That's a safe house.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.160
Boss, I was planning

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.350
to come back and report to you,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.000
but then

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.590
Zhuge Kongyun went in there.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.750
That's when I felt

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:27.510
something was wrong.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.400
Guess what happened next?

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.640
Stop keeping us in suspense.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.310
Just get on with it.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.880
What happened?

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.340
What happened to Mr. Shen?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.830
He died.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.480
Who was it that promised me

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.680
Mr. Shen would be safe

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.880
as long as he retired

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.750
and hid in the countryside?

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.750
Is this how

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.330
you protected him for me?

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.030
Your Majesty,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:51.400
I-I failed in my duty.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.920
I deserve to die for this.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.000
Your Majesty,

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.240
when I learned that Yesha had appeared,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.070
I immediately sent men

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.040
to escort Mr. Shen

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.040
to the safe house.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.040
The safe house was heavily guarded,

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.070
but unexpectedly,

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.930
Yesha still managed to get to him.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.590
How did Mr. Shen die?

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.110
Boss, I followed
your instructions carefully.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.680
I neither approached nor made a sound.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.610
After they left,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.720
I bribed one of the guards.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.790
The guard told me

00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.510
that Mr. Shen was poisoned.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.070
They found poison

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:17.200
in the pastry he ate.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.790
The Secret Investigation Unit

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.550
has made such a grave mistake

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.570
and caused me
to lose a beloved official.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.550
Zhuge Kongyun.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.070
Zhuge Kongyun!

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.060
How long do you intend

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.350
to keep fooling me?

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.130
I wouldn't dare.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.470
I've carefully checked

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:33.830
every room in the safe house.

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.960
In the end, I found

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.400
that the pastry

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:37.590
Mr. Shen ate

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.690
contained a deadly poison—

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:45.990
Heart-Severing Red.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.790
The murder of Mr. Shen

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.520
was the false news we released.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.240
Zhu Yitie is dead,

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.400
and before he died,

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.920
he confessed
to killing Yesha at Fengbo Lake.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.720
So who killed Mr. Shen?

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.440
Was Zhu Yitie lying,

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.400
and Yesha isn't dead at all,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.330
or is Yesha someone else entirely?

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.720
I'm from Haiya.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.790
One of the few survivors.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.440
An orphan of Haiya.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.960
There are no ghosts in this world.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.630
Everything is done by human hands.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.590
Sometimes, humans can be more evil

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.550
than ghosts.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.400
Zhu Yitie once said…

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.480
as long as Haiya

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.960
has a single survivor,

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.670
Yesha will

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:26.310
keep appearing.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.510
If Tong Shuang could
follow the Secret Investigation Unit

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.550
to find Mr. Shen,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.230
so could others.

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.440
We never know if we're the predator
or the prey.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.230
Boss,

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:36.360
did I

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.670
cause Mr. Shen's death?

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.280
It had nothing to do with you.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.440
I miscalculated.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.130
We originally planned to test the waters,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.070
using the Secret Investigation Unit

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:47.320
to protect Mr. Shen

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.800
and then finding a way to meet him.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.280
Unexpectedly,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.139
Yesha turned our plan against us.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.750
So was there a traitor in the safe house?

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.280
Or did someone get bribed?

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.710
At first,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.180
I made the same assumption.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:00.230
[Seal]

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.320
But when the coroner
examined the other pastries,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.400
no poison was found.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.440
Moreover, the food

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.760
at the safe house was inspected

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:06.760
by multiple people.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.820
Bribing all of them

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.840
would be nearly impossible.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.620
I also interrogated

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.230
everyone who inspected the food

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.400
and ruled out
the possibility of poisoning.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.480
You don't need to explain

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.760
so elaborately to me.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.590
Just tell me,

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.000
how did

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.750
the poison get into the pastry?

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:20.230
No, wait.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.440
You saw with your own eyes

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.360
that Mr. Shen was escorted
into the safe house,

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.360
and he was fine at that time,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:24.760
right?

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.870
Yes, perfectly fine.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:26.870
Healthy and well.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.080
Logically speaking,

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.110
once inside the safe house,

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.710
he should've been completely safe.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.480
So how was the poison administered?

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.590
Could it be like

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.880
the Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.190
where the killer bribed someone

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.920
on the inside?

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.400
All food in the safe house

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.000
goes through multiple inspections,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.710
with silver needle testing every time.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.760
If someone wanted to sneak in
and poison him,

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.320
they'd need

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.920
to bribe every single tester.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.110
That was nearly impossible.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.360
I'll go out and investigate further

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.290
to see if there are any other clues.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.280
Your Majesty,

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.880
everything I've said is true.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.920
Poison was indeed found

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.960
in the pastry

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.760
Mr. Shen ate.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.720
But the poison

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.550
was administered by Mr. Shen himself.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:07.960
You mean Mr. Shen

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.710
poisoned himself?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.800
Ridiculous!

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.400
Delicious.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.150
Do you have to munch?

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.840
Would it kill you to eat slower?

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.690
Slow down, or you'll end up

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:26.320
swallowing

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.070
the wax paper

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.480
and get a stomachache.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:30.920
The poison Mr. Shen took

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.120
wasn't in the pastry.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.760
Not in the pastry?

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.190
Then where?

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.590
That's right.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.280
That's like tears flowing
above the eyebrows—

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.280
it makes no sense.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.760
Then how was he poisoned?

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.230
Tong Shuang,

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.220
did Mr. Shen bring any luggage

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.950
when he entered the safe house?

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.000
Just one case.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.150
Probably just some spare clothes.

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:51.770
The poison was in his luggage.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.550
Three years ago,

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.150
Yesha killed those officials

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.960
by exploiting

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.290
their personal habits.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.070
Your Majesty,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:57.880
Mr. Shen didn't

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.000
poison himself intentionally.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.450
Yesha exploited

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:02.190
a habit of his that few would notice.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.920
What habit?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:03.670
Three years ago,

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.960
when I was protecting Mr. Shen,

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.000
I secretly observed him

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.330
from outside his study.

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.860
Mr. Shen had a small habit.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.590
I investigated

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:10.920
Mr. Shen's lecture hall

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.610
and discovered that when reading,

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:12.710
he had this particular habit.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.080
[Rites of Zhou]

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.070
Mr. Shen loved books

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.150
and always had one in hand.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.000
When reading,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.150
he liked to wet his fingertip
with saliva to turn the pages.

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:32.110
All Yesha needed to do

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.400
was poison his books.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.920
I verified this

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.150
with Mr. Shen's students.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:37.510
When reading, Mr. Shen indeed

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:38.110
had the habit

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.070
of wetting his fingertip
with saliva to turn the pages.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.200
If I'm not mistaken,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.240
besides clothes in his luggage,

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.480
there must also have been books.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.210
Poison was found

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:46.480
on the books

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.590
Mr. Shen brought with him.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.920
The poison on the pastry

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.800
came from Mr. Shen's fingers

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.920
after he touched

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.060
the poisoned pages

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.730
and then picked up the pastry.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.900
So that's how it happened.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.670
This fiend Yesha

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:59.400
is so cunning.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:00.800
Yesha is cunning,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.070
but I still failed in my duty.

00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:04.070
Those books

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.550
were brought by Mr. Shen himself.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.520
The guards at the safe house

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.440
thought they were just books,

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.760
so they didn't check them.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.880
That gave Yesha

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.680
the opportunity to strike.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.510
It was my negligence.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.360
Enough.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:15.590
Say no more.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.290
It's been three years,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.690
and I've lost several beloved officials.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.480
I left this case in your charge.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.440
Three years passed,

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.370
and you've made no progress at all.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.630
Dismissing you both
and throwing you in prison

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.760
would be lenient.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.630
It was my miscalculation

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.410
that cost Mr. Shen his life.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.960
My mistake dragged

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.020
the Secret Investigation Unit down.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.280
Boss,

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.630
that father and son

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.230
have always thought you're Yesha

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.510
and hunted you everywhere.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.960
So let them suffer a bit.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.150
The Secret Investigation Unit's goal

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.400
is the same as ours.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.710
They just mistake me for Yesha.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.590
Father.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.400
Yun.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.710
The time left for us

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.190
is running short.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.440
I'll give you one last chance

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.070
to redeem yourselves.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.280
But this time,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.840
there must be a deadline.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.150
Why are you looking at each other?

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.190
Lost your tongue?

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.510
Three months.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:28.710
Within three months…

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:29.510
Three months?

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.000
Three months

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.530
is enough for Yesha
to infiltrate the palace!

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.920
One month.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.830
Your Majesty,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.630
within one month,

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.920
the Secret Investigation Unit will surely

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.920
bring Yesha to justice.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.800
If we fail,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.440
I'm willing to pay with my life.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.070
One month,

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:42.190
not a day more!

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.660
Is there any hope of finding Yesha

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.800
by examining those books?

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.000
Mr. Shen's books

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.670
were left on the desk
in the lecture hall.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.600
Too many people could access them.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.480
Besides, the lecture hall

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.710
was wide open.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.480
Even if someone snuck in with poison,

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.080
there'd be no way to trace it.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.510
So we have no clue at all.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.590
Father,

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:13.760
I want to look into

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.550
the resume documents

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:17.030
of the four officials
from the Blood-Weeping Statues Case.

00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.360
Why look into those?

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.070
I always thought

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.840
Yesha killed them three years ago

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.920
just to create mystery and fear

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.840
and cause panic in the court and beyond,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.350
which is why he chose the officials

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.000
with tombstone statues
in the Lang Hua Pavilion.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.590
But I never expected

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.800
that after all these years,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.920
Yesha would still

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:31.920
go after Mr. Shen.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.510
It makes me suspect

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.440
that Yesha had a compelling reason

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.100
to kill those four officials.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.300
There must be a connection

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.280
among them.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:42.480
The resume documents
of all the Qi Kingdom's officials

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.610
are kept in the Imperial Secretariat.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.400
With this token,

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:49.230
you can get access to it.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.190
