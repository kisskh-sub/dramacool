00:30.905 --> 00:32.824
Hey. Come back to bed.

00:36.077 --> 00:38.288
I have to get ready for work, Rick.
So do you.

00:40.832 --> 00:41.874
Don't remind me.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.044
You ship out today.
You should really be with June.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.712
You're jealous?

00:46.713 --> 00:49.423
You know I'm not.
I'm just not fond of lying.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.675
Yeah. Well, she's a fucking sorceress.

00:51.676 --> 00:52.760
And?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.428
And I'm afraid if I break up with her,

00:54.429 --> 00:56.139
she's gonna burrow a hole
through the planet.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.515
- Dude.
- What?

00:58.516 --> 01:00.642
Can you possibly self-aggrandize more?

01:00.643 --> 01:02.019
I'm serious.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.313
I know. That's the problem.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.065
Maybe it's worth it.

01:05.940 --> 01:06.941
What?

01:09.736 --> 01:10.904
A hole through the planet.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.531
Me and you.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.077
You're the only friend I have, Rick.

01:18.369 --> 01:21.623
And I'm pretty sure I'm yours.
You want to fuck that up?

01:22.957 --> 01:26.377
Newsflash, Emilia Harcourt,
we already fucked that up.

01:31.841 --> 01:32.842
I'm serious.

01:34.594 --> 01:35.636
Come on.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.139
You ship out to Corto Maltese
in two hours.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.441
Peacemaker, what a joke.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.977
Dude, what are you doing?

03:49.938 --> 03:51.689
Dude, it's past eleven.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.026
Dude.

03:55.526 --> 03:56.860
Where the fuck have you been?

03:56.861 --> 03:59.279
Dad and I have been freaked out.
There's blood in the library.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.658
- Where the fuck did that come from?
- What library?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.534
Our library?

04:06.037 --> 04:07.330
Yeah, I...

04:07.914 --> 04:10.083
- call that the trophy room.
- Since when?

04:11.584 --> 04:12.627
Where have you been?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.047
- Are you hungover?
- A little bit.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.717
I thought you were gonna slow down
with all that.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.137
I mean, at least it's just alcohol.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.140
It is just alcohol, right?

04:26.641 --> 04:27.892
Yeah. Yeah.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.062
All right, get up. Come on.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.064
- I'm fixing us some eggs.
- Okay.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.233
Okay.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.072
Shit.

05:08.850 --> 05:09.851
Fuck.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.939
Come on. Piss!

05:24.532 --> 05:25.616
What the fuck?

05:35.209 --> 05:36.294
Whoa.

05:46.804 --> 05:48.514
Keith. Sorry, but I gotta go!

05:49.140 --> 05:52.225
Also, why do all my clothes
look like the Kardashians' furniture! Huh?

05:52.226 --> 05:53.394
Who are the Kardashians?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.103
Seriously?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.189
Where are you going?

05:56.939 --> 05:57.940
I took your advice.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.483
I'm going to see Harcourt.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.985
What about the jarhead?

06:02.528 --> 06:03.570
Fuck him.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.697
Agreed.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.366
Fuck him!

06:06.866 --> 06:07.909
Fuck that guy.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.336
Hey. Before I go,

06:18.920 --> 06:19.921
pop quiz.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.338
- Pop quiz?
- Yes.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.715
Can you name the entire address,
including zip code,

06:23.716 --> 06:25.134
of Emilia Harcourt's workplace?

06:25.676 --> 06:26.676
What?

06:26.677 --> 06:28.762
- Come on, this is fun.
- It's not fun. It's weird.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.472
Why would I know
the address of ARGUS?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.723
ARGUS. Okay, second question.

06:31.724 --> 06:32.808
That counts as right?

06:32.809 --> 06:34.101
Can I borrow the keys to your truck?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.560
What kind of fucking pop quiz is this?

06:35.561 --> 06:38.105
- I don't make the rules, bro.
- It seems like you very much do.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.315
- Why are you being so weird?
- Just answer the question.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.402
Why don't you drive
your fucking Peace-cycle?

06:44.445 --> 06:45.780
That's the correct answer.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.409
What the fuck?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.251
Oh yeah.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.098
Peacemaker!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.600
Peacemaker, I love you!

07:56.601 --> 07:57.851
Love you too, little man.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.187
Peacemaker! I love you!

08:00.188 --> 08:02.355
- Peacemaker!
- That's a bit much.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.483
Peacemaker!

08:08.946 --> 08:11.282
Best. Dimension. Ever.

08:20.917 --> 08:24.253
Shit. Dude.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.298
My head.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.720
How much did we drink last night?

08:33.304 --> 08:34.347
Shoot.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.974
I need some water.

08:39.435 --> 08:42.730
You drank as much as anyone here.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.816
Aren't you in agony?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.152
Does it help somehow to bitch about it?

08:49.153 --> 08:51.280
- You want some coffee?
- Just water.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.790
Chris stormed out of here last night.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.334
Did something go down between you two?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.877
No. Just Chris being Chris.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.171
I don't mean just last night,

09:08.172 --> 09:11.132
but, like, a couple of weeks ago?

09:11.133 --> 09:14.637
Because you guys were hanging out,
like, a lot, and then...

09:17.807 --> 09:21.810
So, did something happen
between you two then?

09:21.811 --> 09:22.894
No.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.437
No way.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.648
How would you know?

09:26.524 --> 09:29.276
'Cause Peacemaker's my best friend,
and we share everything with each other.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.194
- Yeah?
- Even all our deepest, darkest secrets.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.405
Like what?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.615
Like, you know, like...

09:35.157 --> 09:38.160
Okay. Don't make fun of me, but how...

09:40.204 --> 09:41.205
I like spiders.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.249
Peacemaker taught me that that's
not something I should be ashamed of.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.502
Along with owls and dolphins
and manta rays,

09:47.003 --> 09:48.378
they're one of my favorite animals,

09:48.379 --> 09:51.089
and no matter how much I can tell
you're both judging me right now,

09:51.090 --> 09:52.508
I'm not gonna be ashamed of that.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.802
So, your deep, dark secret
is that you dig spiders?

09:55.803 --> 09:57.762
Yes. I know it makes me ghoulish,

09:57.763 --> 09:59.931
but, you know, we all have our faults.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.559
Adrian, how many people have you killed?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.562
How many is a shit-ton?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.438
Wait, why are you changing the subject?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.648
Hey, are you wearing my robe?

10:08.649 --> 10:10.358
I know everything
there is to know about spiders.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.569
- You wanna quiz me on some spider facts?
- No.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.362
I could probably take a spider test
right now

10:14.363 --> 10:15.823
and get a professional entomology degree.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.574
A spider test.

10:17.575 --> 10:19.743
Crows. Crows are also one of my favorites.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.329
Adrian, it is too early for this.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.830
You guys aren't on the crow train?

10:23.831 --> 10:25.915
Oh my God, I know so many crow facts.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.917
Do you know
they're the only bird to use tools?

10:27.918 --> 10:29.836
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah.

10:29.837 --> 10:31.046
They can take a paper clip,

10:31.047 --> 10:34.341
straighten it out,
and then if another crow is being a dick,

10:34.342 --> 10:35.926
he can stab him to death with it.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.637
Crows do that?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.680
I didn't say they do do it.
I said they could.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.849
- You know what, Adrian?
- No. What?

10:42.850 --> 10:44.934
John fell asleep in the bathtub
last night.

10:44.935 --> 10:47.687
I'm suddenly getting afraid
he choked on his own vomit in there.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.772
Fuck!

10:48.773 --> 10:50.774
Why are you just telling me this now?

10:50.775 --> 10:52.317
Why are you encouraging him?

10:52.318 --> 10:56.238
I'm sorry.
I fell face-first in the Adrian vortex.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.698
Whoa, what are you doing?

10:58.699 --> 11:00.326
I'm making sure you're alive.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.702
Why are your fingers in my mouth?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.204
I'm checking for throw-up.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.622
Jesus Christ, dude!

11:05.623 --> 11:06.706
Wait, wait, wait.

11:06.707 --> 11:09.000
So, did something happen
between Chris and you, or no?

11:09.001 --> 11:10.294
Nothing happened.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.505
I'm gonna get some sun. You coming?

11:15.132 --> 11:16.717
Want to quiz me on some spider facts?

11:38.239 --> 11:39.532
I'm here to see Emilia Harcourt.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.826
Mr. Smith! So good to see you.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.829
Hey, what's up, old buddy?

11:45.830 --> 11:47.039
Good to see you again too.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.500
You keeping our country safe, huh?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.001
Absolutely.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.337
How did Mr. Grant's test turn out?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.173
Very positive.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.175
That's terrible.

11:58.676 --> 11:59.677
Right?

12:00.845 --> 12:02.138
I was hoping it wasn't cancer.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.976
Can you just put your eye there
across from the scanner, sir?

12:07.935 --> 12:09.478
Yeah, yes.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.481
- Just like this?
- That's perfect.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.534
All set.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.330
Picture of me.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.665
Third floor, of course.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.334
Ms. Harcourt will be waiting for you.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.298
He just said

12:38.299 --> 12:41.259
you guys went on a party boat
a couple weeks ago,

12:41.260 --> 12:43.637
and you kinda ghosted him after.

12:44.138 --> 12:45.597
I didn't ghost anyone.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.724
Did something happen?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.435
- Where?
- On the party boat.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.520
No, Ads. I told you, no.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.938
- Well...
- Well, what?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.774
- Why not?
- Are you kidding me?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.193
No. Chris, he's nice. He's funny.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.569
He's got splendid hygiene.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.905
Yeah, other than the eagle shit
everywhere.

13:01.906 --> 13:04.033
Other than that, he's super-yoked,

13:04.658 --> 13:05.910
nice jawline,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.620
and he's in love with you.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.704
Shut up.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.873
- What?
- He's not.

13:11.874 --> 13:16.085
He sat by your bed for five days
while you were in a coma, Em.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.923
He wears a fucking clown costume.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.008
- Dude.
- What?

13:22.009 --> 13:23.885
I'm just saying, I love you,

13:23.886 --> 13:27.306
but you're not exactly
the picture of a balanced life.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.058
All right.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.393
When I first met you,
I thought you had it all together.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.729
And I'm not saying
you don't come off cool, you do.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.190
But since really getting to know you,

13:37.191 --> 13:39.359
I realized you're more fucked up
than anyone I know.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.486
Okay, Economos and Vigilante?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.570
Well, not them,

13:42.571 --> 13:44.739
but you're a fucking train wreck.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.825
Okay.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.785
What's that?

13:48.786 --> 13:51.037
That's you exploding
'cause you're so fucked up.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.706
Look, your point is taken,

13:53.457 --> 13:56.085
but me and Chris is not a thing.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.962
It's never gonna be a thing.

13:58.587 --> 13:59.588
He know that?

14:13.936 --> 14:15.270
When he gets really happy,

14:15.271 --> 14:17.731
he's got one ear that just,
like, sticks up.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.149
- Just the one ear. Cute.
- Thank you.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.361
I think I’m going to have to rescue,
like, seven more dogs.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.323
- This is fucking stupid.
- Hey.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.409
What's going on, Chris?

14:28.909 --> 14:30.035
Jesus fucking Christ.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.289
You got, like,
some business or something here?

14:37.585 --> 14:38.711
What's up, Rick?

14:39.336 --> 14:40.379
Just asking you.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.422
How you doing, man?

14:42.423 --> 14:43.590
- Going--
- Chris.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.842
Yeah, I was just asking him
what he's doing here.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.845
If he's got, like, something official,
or something I should be a part of.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.639
No, Rick, it's personal.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.683
- Personal?
- It's...

14:53.684 --> 14:54.767
friendly.

14:54.768 --> 14:55.853
Chris wanted to talk.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.398
- Just wanted to talk, huh?
- Yeah.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.692
Like, about what, dude?

15:04.153 --> 15:07.239
Hey, Rick, will you just--
will let us talk?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.116
Yeah. Of course. I'm cool.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.041
Hey, Harcourt.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.043
Oh hey, Smith.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.629
What, we're calling each other
by our last names now?

15:22.212 --> 15:24.589
No, just being funny.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.550
- Hilarious.
- Sorry.

15:27.676 --> 15:29.929
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was...

15:30.721 --> 15:32.056
I didn't mean to bust your balls.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.682
So, hey.

15:34.683 --> 15:35.892
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:35.893 --> 15:36.977
Hey.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.528
Oh my God.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.239
I am so sorry.
He was not supposed to be in today.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.325
The jarhead?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.952
I don't know
why you and Keith call him that.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.079
He's army, not Marines, so not a jarhead.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.415
Yeah. Right.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.588
Let's just go out, okay? Is that cool?

16:06.215 --> 16:07.967
- Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.685
- Sh-- shit. Shit! Shit!
- Come on.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.187
Hey, that's not supposed to be
around the corner.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.731
- I-- I-- I told you that.
- Whoops.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.359
See, this is all,

16:25.901 --> 16:27.945
shit, a big problem.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.791
Glad you came.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.626
Me too.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.048
We're both going down at the same time.
You know what they call that?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.092
I don't.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.969
An elevator ride.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.304
- Is that what they call it?
- Some of the kids do.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.974
How many eyes does a tarantula have?

16:57.975 --> 16:59.018
Trick question.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.854
Eyes by definition
come in pairs, so two.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.273
Tarantulas have eight eyes.

17:05.274 --> 17:06.566
Shit.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.195
You said that so confidently,
I had to actually look back at my phone.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.030
Eyes don't always come in pairs.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.114
Right.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.866
I forgot about Martians, one big eye.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.784
Ask me if tarantulas are furry.

17:16.785 --> 17:19.413
I already know they're furry
and it's gross.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.623
That's a little harsh.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.671
- Fuck.
- Who is it?

17:29.006 --> 17:30.006
Hello?

17:30.007 --> 17:33.468
Why didn't you tell us Smith
has some kind of super-powered duck?

17:33.469 --> 17:34.719
A meta-duck.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.596
He doesn't have a super-powered duck.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.514
He's got a regular eagle.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.807
That regular eagle

17:39.808 --> 17:41.350
just took down five agents.

17:41.351 --> 17:42.643
One's in the ICU.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.145
<i>Another lost an eye.</i>

17:44.146 --> 17:47.232
Another one needs to have
reconstructive facial surgery.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.276
Fuck. Okay, I'll be right in.

17:50.277 --> 17:51.570
Make it fast.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.655
He told me duck.

17:54.156 --> 17:57.034
What kind of man takes advantage
of another man's bird blindness?

18:01.246 --> 18:03.122
Sorry. Excuse me. Okay.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.291
Who was that?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.543
Fucking work. I gotta go.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.089
Where the fuck are my pants?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.509
I washed and folded them
and put them on the kitchen counter.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.180
Jesus Christ,
why would you fucking do that?

18:30.484 --> 18:32.693
Hey, they have some pretty
good hot dogs over there.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.655
- You want a hot dog?
- Sure.

18:40.702 --> 18:41.912
- Thank you.
- Good.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.539
What do you want on here?
You want some mustard?

18:44.540 --> 18:45.623
Actually, you got this?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.583
- I got it, I got it.
- All right, cool, no problem.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.377
- Okay...
- Oh my God.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.338
- Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no, that's good, that's good.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.465
I'm gonna take this one.
I like a lot of mustard,

18:54.466 --> 18:56.467
like a one-to-one mustard
to hot dog ratio, so...

18:56.468 --> 18:58.261
- Do you?
- This is gonna work for me.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.637
- Is it?
- I'm just gonna...

18:59.638 --> 19:01.932
I don't know what else to do.
Can I get a straw?

19:49.521 --> 19:52.608
So, you wanted to talk?

19:53.817 --> 19:54.902
Well, yeah, I...

19:55.903 --> 19:57.446
I just wanted to see what's going on.

19:59.615 --> 20:00.699
What's that mean?

20:02.075 --> 20:03.076
You know,

20:03.619 --> 20:04.620
see what's happening.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.122
What's happening?

20:09.791 --> 20:11.918
With, like, you and Rick Flag
or whatever.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.502
I mean, he's a good guy.

20:13.503 --> 20:15.214
He's not gonna fuck around on me.

20:17.799 --> 20:18.800
What?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.219
No...

20:21.345 --> 20:22.804
it's good that he doesn't do that.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.768
You know, I've...

20:29.561 --> 20:31.605
changed a lot since I last saw you.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.148
- Yeah, you seem less arrogant.
- Yeah?

20:34.149 --> 20:35.609
Sorry. I mean...

20:36.360 --> 20:38.070
No, no, no, no, no.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.947
I've actually been working on that.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.449
That and a lot of other stuff.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.494
- What?
- Like your delts.

20:46.495 --> 20:48.538
I'm just waiting
for you to say like your delts.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.874
Always my delts, you know.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.962
But seriously, stuff like...

20:56.630 --> 20:58.966
how I push people away by being a dick.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.762
And just trauma that
I've had my whole life that I just

21:04.554 --> 21:06.682
let define me, you know?

21:09.351 --> 21:10.352
What?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.604
You really are different.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.314
I am.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.736
Last night in the texts...

21:20.779 --> 21:22.489
Sorry, I was a little drunk.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.741
- You think?
- Sorry.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.454
You said you wanted to explore things?

21:30.455 --> 21:31.622
Yeah.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.748
What did you...

21:32.749 --> 21:33.833
- Mean?
- Yeah.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.502
This is what I meant. This.

21:36.503 --> 21:37.671
Like, to see you.

21:38.588 --> 21:39.798
See if anything was there.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.342
The last thing I need is

21:43.302 --> 21:46.846
getting my heart broken again
because you're curious, Chris.

21:46.847 --> 21:47.931
Right.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.599
You really hurt me.

21:50.851 --> 21:51.893
I'm sorry.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.106
I mean,
if I was ever to reconsider things...

21:57.107 --> 21:58.190
Yeah?

21:58.191 --> 22:00.610
...I couldn't have somebody
fucking around on me all the time.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.570
I wouldn't do that.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.071
- Sure.
- I'm serious.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.657
And I couldn't have someone
walking out on me

22:06.658 --> 22:08.326
just because they thought I was, like,

22:08.327 --> 22:10.370
criticizing their driving or whatever.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.789
Right. That's bullshit.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.375
Somebody would really
have to fucking commit.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.879
I don't know. We'd both have to--

22:19.880 --> 22:22.132
- to think about it, you know?
- Yeah.

22:22.632 --> 22:24.925
The last thing I need
is you being impulsive

22:24.926 --> 22:26.594
and saying you want this

22:26.595 --> 22:28.846
and then changing your mind
three days later,

22:28.847 --> 22:30.307
Chris-Smith-style.

22:31.725 --> 22:32.768
Okay.

22:33.769 --> 22:34.770
I'll think about it.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.272
I mean,

22:37.773 --> 22:40.274
you know, I guess if all those things
were in place,

22:40.275 --> 22:41.902
we could see where we were.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.487
Yeah.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.073
I-- I should get back to--

22:51.161 --> 22:52.162
Jerry!

22:52.621 --> 22:53.663
Fuck!

22:54.289 --> 22:57.125
Hey, you can't come in here
with that stuff! Stop!

23:00.754 --> 23:02.297
Everybody get the fuck on the floor!

23:04.341 --> 23:06.885
The man said,
"Down on the motherfucking ground!"

23:22.818 --> 23:24.403
- You okay?
- Yeah.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.705
Oh Jesus.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.667
Fucking Sons again.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.502
They're gonna kill more people.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.796
We, the Sons of Liberty,

23:43.797 --> 23:46.383
are united in fighting our oppressors.

23:50.053 --> 23:53.055
They have ruled all of us
under their corrupt thumb

23:53.056 --> 23:55.057
- for long enough.
- No, no.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.143
That is why we're gonna continue
to destroy

23:57.144 --> 23:59.104
one governmental agency a week

24:00.105 --> 24:02.482
until our demands are met.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.650
Hey, if any of you pigs come closer,

24:04.651 --> 24:06.570
I swear to God
somebody in here is gonna die.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.326
Move quickly but carefully.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.204
This stuff is dangerous.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.915
You all saw what happened
to Jerry out there.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.755
Step the fuck back!

24:27.674 --> 24:29.175
I need backup. I need it right now.

24:29.176 --> 24:31.010
Everything you got. Step back, lady.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.304
ARGUS.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.221
- Sorry, ma'am.
- What do we know?

24:34.222 --> 24:37.099
A group of them went in,
maybe nine or ten, carrying bags.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.518
There could be enough
cefanalolol explosives in them

24:39.519 --> 24:41.521
- to blow up the whole block.
- "Cefanalolol"?

24:42.230 --> 24:43.522
That a real word?

24:43.523 --> 24:45.065
The same as was used to blow up

24:45.066 --> 24:46.901
that Housing and Development office
last week.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.403
"Housing and Development"?

24:48.987 --> 24:50.446
Chris, I think you should stand down.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.740
I think you might be
having a reaction to the blow.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.035
No, I got a little dizzy, shaken up.
I'm-- I'm fine.

24:55.994 --> 24:57.119
We got backup on the way,

24:57.120 --> 24:58.704
but it's only gonna take
the Sons of Liberty

24:58.705 --> 25:00.081
a few minutes to set up that bomb.

25:00.957 --> 25:01.999
Chris, where are you going?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.002
I'll be back in a minute. I'm fine.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.754
You got a way to your roof?

25:06.755 --> 25:08.756
I gotta get these little guys
out of here, man,

25:08.757 --> 25:09.965
before they blow them all up.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.717
Hey. I'm going to stop that
from happening, okay?

25:11.718 --> 25:12.802
I gotta get to your roof.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.846
- It's in there.
- Yeah.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.640
Come on, little guy.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.745
Oh my God.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.376
Hey, you hear something?

25:45.377 --> 25:46.877
Quit freaking out, dude.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.546
I heard something, though.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.007
- Upstairs.
- Yeah, then go check it out.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.845
- That guy's Peacemaker, right?
- Yeah.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.556
But he ain't wearing his suit.

25:58.557 --> 25:59.683
No.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.280
Wait.

26:14.990 --> 26:15.991
What happened?

26:25.458 --> 26:27.711
Hey! That's close enough!

26:36.928 --> 26:38.512
Somebody here is gonna die

26:38.513 --> 26:41.307
just looking for an excuse
to kill this state-owned bitch!

26:41.308 --> 26:42.475
So, just give it to me.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.279
Fuck was that?

26:55.405 --> 26:56.489
Brad, you there?

26:58.575 --> 26:59.618
Jim?

27:01.911 --> 27:03.246
Gary, you better go check that out.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.266
Yeah, I-- I don't get it.
Everyone seems to be--

27:34.903 --> 27:36.988
Just finish it
and let's get the fuck out of here.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.679
A-- Amy!

28:24.327 --> 28:26.204
Where are you, motherfucker?

28:27.539 --> 28:29.082
I'll fucking kill you.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.272
That's our ride.

28:53.481 --> 28:54.524
Let's go.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.405
Let's go!

29:07.036 --> 29:08.288
Should be any minute!

30:02.759 --> 30:05.887
We've waited long enough!
We gotta go! Go! Go!

30:07.263 --> 30:08.264
Fuck!

30:32.121 --> 30:33.789
- You stop the bomb?
- Fuck yeah!

30:33.790 --> 30:36.000
Fucking Chrisper! Yeah!

30:48.888 --> 30:50.181
Best dimension ever.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.483
- You tip off Smith, Economos?
- What? No. Me? No.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.610
Then how did he know
to have that bird in place?

31:03.611 --> 31:05.821
- Eagly is always there.
- Eagly.

31:05.822 --> 31:08.699
- Yeah, read his dossier, dude.
- Don't "dude" me.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.617
Your life at ARGUS is hanging
by a thread.

31:10.618 --> 31:11.702
Don't blame me.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.662
You didn't even consult me
about breaking in.

31:13.663 --> 31:15.414
Blame him. I told him about the eagle.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.207
You told me it was a duck.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.334
The fuck I did.
Why would I say an eagle is a duck?

31:19.335 --> 31:20.627
A practical joke.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.963
Trying to use my disability against me.

31:22.964 --> 31:25.966
Is it funny? Yeah. Very.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.968
But you almost got Titties killed.

31:27.969 --> 31:29.136
I said eagle.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.220
None of this matters.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.431
What matters
is the dimensional discrepancy

31:32.432 --> 31:34.099
Vega picked up in the house.

31:34.100 --> 31:37.020
After the Metropolis incident
took out half the city,

31:37.604 --> 31:39.605
these type of threats
are ARGUS's top priority.

31:39.606 --> 31:43.442
I have every agent in the Northwest
on the way to Smith's home now.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.069
And I brought in Red St. Wild here
to assist.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.821
How you doing there, sonny boy?

31:47.822 --> 31:50.408
- World's foremost eagle hunter.
- Eagle hunter?

31:50.950 --> 31:52.993
- He's gonna kill Eagly?
- We can't take chances.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.412
Ain't no one kills a eagle
more good than me.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.164
Yeah, that's nothing to be proud of.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.001
In what fucking country
is hunting eagles even allowed?

32:00.501 --> 32:02.503
For the next few hours, ours.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.546
First, we kill the bird.

32:04.547 --> 32:06.506
And any other eagle in the vicinity?

32:06.507 --> 32:08.509
No, just the bird in the house.

32:09.052 --> 32:11.303
Then we do our best to take Smith alive.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.263
I'm sorry, our best?

32:13.264 --> 32:15.140
I know he's your buddy, Economos.

32:15.141 --> 32:17.851
But if he really
is in possession of a dimensional portal,

32:17.852 --> 32:19.770
he's not going to see
the outside of a prison

32:19.771 --> 32:20.938
for the rest of his life.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.147
Are you in or not?

32:22.148 --> 32:24.316
I'm not. Fuck this.

32:24.317 --> 32:25.984
- Then you're fired.
- I'm in.

32:25.985 --> 32:29.196
But I don't wanna work
with some piece of shit eagle killer.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.697
- Come on, man.
- You don't have to.

32:30.698 --> 32:32.741
I'm partnering you up with our new agent,

32:32.742 --> 32:33.825
Rip Jagger.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.453
Who the fuck is Rip Jagger?

32:37.705 --> 32:38.748
Hey, fatty.

32:39.457 --> 32:40.875
Fuck!

33:20.164 --> 33:21.207
Everything good?

33:21.874 --> 33:23.334
Yeah. Yeah.

33:25.461 --> 33:26.504
Thanks.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.468
You good, man?

33:33.886 --> 33:35.930
Yeah, I'm great.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.850
Dad's just been a little worried,
you know?

33:40.560 --> 33:43.688
You've been disappearing
even more than usual.

33:46.649 --> 33:47.900
You aren't, like...

33:49.360 --> 33:51.362
taking the pills again or anything?

33:52.822 --> 33:53.823
No.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.830
You know I love you no matter what, right?

34:02.540 --> 34:05.334
I mean, I don't say it enough, but...

34:06.711 --> 34:07.712
you're my brother,

34:08.421 --> 34:10.465
and you always will be
no matter what you do.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.135
And you can always tell me
what's going on.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.057
I really...

34:23.394 --> 34:24.437
missed you.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.566
More than you could ever...

34:31.152 --> 34:33.362
You don't gotta miss me, man.
I'm right here.

34:34.238 --> 34:35.531
I'm not going anywhere.

34:36.157 --> 34:37.617
I never will go anywhere.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.704
I am now and always
will be your big brother.

34:44.499 --> 34:45.500
I love you, buddy.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.462
You did good today.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.504
Sleep well.
