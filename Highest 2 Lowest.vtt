03:11.233 --> 03:14.485
Yeah. Yeah, Gabe. No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.738
It's not a risk. It's a rebirth.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.782
Look, the biggest mistake I ever made

03:19.783 --> 03:23.160
was selling off parts of Stackin' Hits
in the first place.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.662
Yeah.

03:24.663 --> 03:28.791
Yeah, it all came to me last night.
The money, the buyout, the vote.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.712
It's not the ending.
It's an opportunity for a new beginning.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.798
When God gives you an opportunity
for a new beginning, you gotta take it.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.800
You don't tell God, "No." You just...

03:37.801 --> 03:39.928
You take it and you make it work.

03:41.138 --> 03:46.768
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.062
Right. Whatever needs to be in there.
You're the smart guy.

03:50.063 --> 03:53.524
That's why I pay you 5%. Whatever
needs to be in there, you put it in there.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.152
I'll have Paul pick it up within an hour.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.447
That's correct. Yes, yes.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.532
That's it. That's it, that's it.
All right.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.660
Good. Good. Good. Good, good, good.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.788
It is a beautiful day.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.344
There she is.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.596
- Good morning, Mr. King.
- Great morning.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.848
- Are you leaving already?
- I can wait.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.601
I got an early meeting, but it can wait.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.687
- I have somewhere to be too, you know.
- What's the occasion?

04:31.688 --> 04:34.023
I've got this Studio Museum in Harlem
board luncheon.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.942
- Oh, right.
- I'm gonna pledge the same

04:35.943 --> 04:39.195
- half a million dollars we did last year.
- Now, can we wait on that?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.781
David, you know
I'm chairperson of the board.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.951
Well, how about a smaller check for now?

04:45.452 --> 04:46.452
What is up?

04:46.453 --> 04:49.956
Nothin'. We just need to keep things
tight and right for right now.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.792
- "Right now"? That sounds wrong to me.
- Okay.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.628
We've always supported
young, Black artists.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.255
I'm positive our sister, Thelma,

04:57.256 --> 05:00.216
will, you know, give us a grace period,
let us circle back.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.676
- You're right.
- Yeah, if we need to.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.761
We're good. We're good. We're good.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.389
"Good, good, good," until when?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.933
Until after you've sold Stackin' Hits?

05:10.894 --> 05:13.272
- Trey, we gotta go!
- I'm coming.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.692
Your mother's giving me
the third degree over here.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.071
- Couldn't find my headband.
- Yeah, you should've really forgot it.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.115
What'd I tell you about
wearing 'em colors in my house?

05:24.116 --> 05:26.535
You know, that's the... I can't even say it.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.247
- Boston Celtics?
- This team like... Celtics!

05:30.956 --> 05:32.082
I'm out.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.000
Hurry up.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.669
- I'm comin'.
- Gotta go.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.339
- Love you.
- I love you more.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.467
Play hard. Play smart.

05:49.892 --> 05:51.684
You like to gamble?

05:51.685 --> 05:53.644
- Do I gamble? No.
- You gamble?

05:53.645 --> 05:57.315
I bet you can't turn that phone off
for five minutes.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.275
- How much you paying?
- How much you got?

05:59.276 --> 06:00.902
Not enough to bet with you.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.863
How many hours a day you on that?

06:03.447 --> 06:05.239
- I don't know.
- Okay, take a guess.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.868
Approximate. You know, ballpark.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.454
Ballpark, I'll probably say five hours.

06:11.455 --> 06:15.167
All right. Five hours on the phone,
ten hours sleeping,

06:15.918 --> 06:17.543
three hours eating,

06:17.544 --> 06:19.254
and two minutes with your girl.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.465
You don't think that's a little excessive?

06:22.466 --> 06:24.759
- Five hours?
- I gotta get more followers.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.428
To have followers, you gotta be leadin'.
Where you leadin' 'em to?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.097
I'm just askin'. Where you leadin'?

06:30.098 --> 06:32.725
- To the promised land.
- Oh, yeah? Wow.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.102
You a preacher now?
You leadin' 'em to the promised land?

06:35.103 --> 06:38.690
Wait, what scriptures you give 'em?
"Thou shalt not listen to bad music"?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.319
Just do what your father said.
Turn it off, son.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.739
This ain't the promised land.
We on Earth. Turn it off.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.993
- I have to turn--
- Turn the phone off. David said so.

06:50.994 --> 06:54.748
Or I will strike thee down
with a vengeance, and...

06:58.585 --> 07:00.504
He mad now. He mad.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.092
- My baby mad. Yeah, he grown mad.
- Come on, man.

07:13.559 --> 07:16.519
Did you get a chance
to listen to Sula yet?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.271
- Sula who?
- Now, come on, Dad.

07:18.272 --> 07:22.275
She's the shorty that I put on your
need-to-know, need-to-listen playlist.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.777
Now, come on.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.200
So, the girls DM you
to get me to listen to them?

07:31.201 --> 07:34.453
It's one of the perks. What can I say?
Got it like that.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.330
- You got it like that, huh?
- Uh-huh.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.624
So, what is she like, this Sula?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.710
She's great. She can sing.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.462
She writes her own songs.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.174
Kinda look like
a more "light-skinned-ed" Zendaya.

07:46.175 --> 07:47.885
A "light-skinned-ed" Zendaya?

07:48.886 --> 07:50.428
I need you to listen to her soon,

07:50.429 --> 07:52.472
'cause I'm supposed to hook up
this weekend.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.142
- You mean, like, "hook up" hook up?
- Nah, not "hook up" hook up.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.270
Just hook up,
like a legit business meeting.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.647
You want me to listen to her
because she can sing,

08:01.648 --> 08:04.443
or do you want me to listen to her
because you like her?

08:05.402 --> 08:08.321
- Yeah, both.
- Okay, okay, okay.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.615
Well, I'll listen to her.
Soon as I come up for air.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.867
"We slow, we blow. We snooze, we lose."

08:12.868 --> 08:15.369
That's how we lost the last artist,
and those are your words.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.165
Just give me something I could tell her.
Just anything.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.712
I'll listen...

08:24.796 --> 08:26.256
when I come up for air.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.470
Dad, you know,
Stackin' Hits Records is my legacy too.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.306
This week will be about your talent,

08:35.307 --> 08:37.307
your attitude, and your skill.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.268
Most important being your attitude.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.230
Do not bring the wrong attitude
into this gym.

08:42.231 --> 08:45.441
- Coach Fox runs a tight ship.
- Yeah, too tight.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.152
Nah. That's the way it is.
That's the way it should be.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.821
- There go Mr. King. Gonna get that.
- All right.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.115
- Good morning, David.
- What'd you say?

08:53.116 --> 08:55.785
- Good morning, Mr. King.
- Good morning, lil Kyle.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.621
- Yes.
- Okay. Yeah, okay.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.624
- What's poppin', man?
- Yo, what's going on, man?

09:02.751 --> 09:04.418
- Hello there, Mr. King.
- Yes, sir.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.754
- Is that my headband?
- Yeah. You left it in my closet.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.923
- I just took it.
- Okay, okay.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.800
- All right. How you been?
- I'm good.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.886
- All right. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Excited for another summer camp session.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.765
See if we can get Trey and Kyle here
to pass to someone other than each other.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.768
- Good luck with that.
- Where do I put my gear?

09:20.769 --> 09:23.354
Bags by the bleachers,
but no phones this year.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.232
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you. Jewelry too.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.361
We gonna work on your handles,
not your TikTok highlight reels.

09:30.028 --> 09:32.154
Put this in the lockbox.
You'll get it at the end of the day.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.824
You hanging around, right?

09:34.825 --> 09:36.659
I gotta get to the office.
Something important came up.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.786
Paul is gonna pick me up.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.454
I promise, I promise
I'll be here tomorrow.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.998
You told me last night
you were gonna come.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.541
Tomorrow. That's a promise.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.209
I'll put this in the lockbox.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.713
- They lock yours too?
- Obviously.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.631
- All right, love you, Dad.
- Love you more.

09:50.632 --> 09:54.343
- You got two fine young men there.
- Yes, I do. Godson and son.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.013
- Purple and gold.
- You almost got me to say it.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.890
- Orange and blue, right?
- Come on.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.058
Hey, we got 17, y'all got two!

10:01.059 --> 10:03.102
Green's my color, you know what I mean?

10:03.103 --> 10:05.021
- Where you going?
- How many you got of the 17?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.814
I got three.
That's better than two, though.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.024
You got me.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.484
You got me by 15. All right.

10:10.485 --> 10:14.030
Hey! What are y'all doing?
Get on the baseline!

10:14.031 --> 10:17.366
Both of you, let's go.
What do you think this is?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.285
- Sorry, Coach.
- You think this is a circus?

10:19.286 --> 10:22.079
- No, sir.
- Trey, Kyle, down back, down back.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.290
Go!

10:24.499 --> 10:27.126
You got Jordans on.
What would Michael say?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.087
- Who's Michael?
- Who is Michael?

10:30.506 --> 10:32.424
Faster, let's go! Faster!

10:40.349 --> 10:41.682
- King.
- Yeah.

10:41.683 --> 10:44.685
- Yeah. My fault. Traffic.
- Yeah.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.312
Let me run in real quick
and say goodbye to Kyle.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.482
That's all right,
we'll see him when we get back.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.484
Damn!

10:54.530 --> 10:57.240
This is everything he gave me.

10:57.241 --> 11:01.370
He said all the statements are in order,
and the formal offer's at the very back.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.542
- Everything there?
- Yeah. It's just strange

11:07.543 --> 11:11.754
seeing your whole life
reduced to a series of numbers.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.172
I overstand.

11:13.173 --> 11:17.844
NYSID #12022001K. That was me upstate.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.512
I like your numbers better.

11:19.513 --> 11:21.097
What else did Gabe say?

11:21.098 --> 11:24.767
He said, "David is officially
the craziest client I ever had

11:24.768 --> 11:27.478
- for trying to pull this off."
- Yeah? What you think?

11:27.479 --> 11:30.273
- My name is Bennett, and I'm not in it.
- No, no.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.150
- My name is Paul, and I can't call.
- Come on now.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.737
You're the mogul, I drive the vehicle.
I'm just the man next to the man.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.866
And your sister's name is Ruth, right?
So tell the truth.

11:39.867 --> 11:42.243
On the serious tip,
what you think? Seriously.

11:42.244 --> 11:45.455
Listen,
you either build or destroy, beloved.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.833
I think you gotta be a little crazy
sometimes in this world

11:48.834 --> 11:49.918
to get what you want.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.254
Appreciate you, bruh.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.256
New mixes or mood music?

11:55.257 --> 11:57.633
- I need a theme.
- Theme music.

11:57.634 --> 12:00.137
- Theme music.
- Theme.

13:09.665 --> 13:13.000
- You again? We not doing this today.
- It's all right, Luther. You again?

13:13.001 --> 13:15.294
- Sixty seconds.
- Quick 60. Go ahead. Go.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.089
<i>Have you heard the good word?</i>

13:18.090 --> 13:20.466
<i>Oh, I'm free as a bird</i>

13:20.467 --> 13:22.927
<i>Oh, I have what it takes</i>

13:22.928 --> 13:25.847
<i>You can make no mistake</i>

13:25.848 --> 13:30.893
<i>When you fell bigger beasts
I'm the choir who sings</i>

13:30.894 --> 13:33.604
<i>I'm the best of the kingdom</i>

13:33.605 --> 13:36.274
<i>And you are the king</i>

13:36.275 --> 13:41.404
<i>The keeper of brothers
The parter of seas</i>

13:41.405 --> 13:46.534
<i>You just need a miracle
Made out of me</i>

13:46.535 --> 13:51.789
<i>If one minute's all
that I get of your time</i>

13:51.790 --> 13:57.128
<i>To you I will dedicate every line</i>

13:57.129 --> 14:02.592
<i>If this is my last chance
I humbly beseech</i>

14:02.593 --> 14:09.266
<i>His highness King David
Sir David the King</i>

14:13.228 --> 14:14.562
David, David, sir.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.648
This Marisol Cepeda. She's a young lady
from the Boogie Down Bronx.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.901
- It's a dream come true to meet you.
- My pleasure.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.444
I grew up on your work with Mariah.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.779
She sings like her and raps too, sir.
She's a double threat.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.531
Good, good.
What part of the Bronx you from?

14:25.532 --> 14:26.616
Fordham and Davidson.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.618
- There you go. I hope to see you again.
- Yeah.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.786
- I hope so too, Mr. King.
- You can call me David.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.247
- You ain't gotta call me Mr. King.
- I hope so, David.

14:33.248 --> 14:34.916
Okay, I like that.
It's okay to be nervous.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.626
It's all right. I like her.

14:36.627 --> 14:39.587
- I'ma hold you to that promise.
- Okay, I bet you will.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.965
I got another meeting.
It was nice to meet you.

14:42.758 --> 14:45.344
- Morning, Julie.
- Good morning to you, Mr. King.

14:49.473 --> 14:50.974
- David.
- Hey.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.770
Got your text about this new singer Sula.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.147
Yeah, yeah.
My son says she's the next big thing.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.150
- You gonna bring her in for a meeting?
- When I get the time.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.947
By the time you get the time, Stray Dog
Enterprises will have bought us out.

15:05.656 --> 15:06.740
Watch me.

15:10.202 --> 15:13.329
I know what you gonna say
before you say it.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.500
"They're more than just a water business."

15:17.417 --> 15:19.252
They're not only a water business.

15:19.253 --> 15:21.629
They're a holding company.
A foreign conglomerate.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.423
Do they care about the brand,
Stackin' Hits Records?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.925
Do they care about the legacy?

15:25.926 --> 15:27.718
If they didn't care,
why's a deal on the table?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.346
The minute they buy us out,

15:30.097 --> 15:33.015
they'll drop all the new artists
we've been trying to develop.

15:33.016 --> 15:38.313
They'll pimp out our entire catalog
for tampons and Viagra commercials.

15:40.232 --> 15:45.278
They'll squeeze every drop
of Black culture and artistic integrity

15:45.279 --> 15:48.448
that I spent the last 25 years
of my life trying to build.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.534
And I'm not even talking about the...
What do you call it?

15:51.535 --> 15:54.787
The AI and the IA and the AEIOU.

15:54.788 --> 15:59.125
Do they care about the music, Patrick?
About our music?

15:59.126 --> 16:01.377
- AI's the future of music, David.
- Yeah?

16:01.378 --> 16:06.966
Machines that compose music
with no soul, no heart.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.760
- They wanna keep you on as an adviser.
- I bet they do.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.847
- David, it's a lot of money.
- I know it's a lot of money.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.058
- Do you? Really?
- Yes! Yes!

16:16.685 --> 16:18.020
If we do this,

16:18.812 --> 16:22.482
we both will walk away
with a very substantial sum.

16:23.108 --> 16:26.904
There's more to life
than just making money.

16:27.613 --> 16:29.989
There's integrity.
There's what you stand for.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.365
There's what you actually believe in.

16:31.366 --> 16:34.994
I believe in the basic fact that it's
called the music business for a reason.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.413
"Business" being the key word.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.790
All money ain't good money, Patrick.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.959
I know what you gonna do.
You're gonna vote yes

16:41.960 --> 16:44.086
when it comes down to the vote, huh?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.965
Yeah. In my opinion, it's time to sell.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.718
I agree. Sell it to me.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.429
- What?
- Sell to me.

16:53.764 --> 16:55.389
What is this?

16:55.390 --> 16:57.517
That's a financial document.

16:57.518 --> 16:59.602
A prospective on Stackin' Hits Records.

16:59.603 --> 17:03.690
I had Gabe write up a formal offer
for me to buy out your shares.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.817
- You wanna buy me out?
- Yeah.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.611
Same deal you'd get from Stray Dog.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.364
And if I have your shares,
I can control the vote.

17:11.365 --> 17:13.449
You understand the company business.

17:13.450 --> 17:15.242
- You talked to the rest of the board?
- No.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.746
If you didn't wanna fill them in, why
did you sell five years ago to begin with?

17:18.747 --> 17:20.998
At the time,
I thought it was a lucrative deal,

17:20.999 --> 17:23.209
and it was an expensive mistake.
I'm sorry.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.962
My company's been going downhill
ever since,

17:25.963 --> 17:28.506
and I'm trying to take back control.

17:28.507 --> 17:31.509
And I'm trying to keep it quiet
because if I tell Alex,

17:31.510 --> 17:34.387
they'll go across the street to Stray Dog
and get a better offer,

17:34.388 --> 17:37.140
and you know I can't compete with them
at a bidding war.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.936
- Patrick, say yes.
- No, no, David.

17:41.937 --> 17:45.481
- No, no, no, no. It doesn't feel right.
- Say yes. Say yes.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.025
It doesn't have to feel right.
Right depends upon your point of view,

17:48.026 --> 17:51.487
and I came to you because I thought
we shared the same point of view.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.781
I guess I was wrong.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.494
Say yes.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.582
Make the deal.

18:03.542 --> 18:06.128
Say yes. Say yes.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.468
Say yes.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.389
Can you have the money ready
before the vote?

18:18.390 --> 18:19.807
Yes, we can.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.102
Thank you. Thank you, brother.

18:30.319 --> 18:33.487
No, I got you, but you don't get me.
I said, if we liquidate the entire--

18:33.488 --> 18:36.032
- Mr. King, you got a package.
- If we liquidate the entire account,

18:36.033 --> 18:37.451
what does that leave us?

18:38.493 --> 18:39.786
That's it?

18:41.246 --> 18:43.164
All right, all right.
All right, pull the trigger.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.458
- Pull the trigger.
- I'll be at my station.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.086
- Okay. Pam, you here?
- I'm in the kitchen.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.172
- What are you doing home?
- I got great news.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.758
- Do tell.
- Buying back Stackin' Hits Records.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.301
You're buying back Stackin' Hits Records?

18:55.302 --> 18:56.844
Just the controlling interest for now.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.806
- This way I'll be able to veto the sale.
- Wait a minute, you...

19:02.226 --> 19:04.519
You said this whole deal
was a good move. That...

19:04.520 --> 19:07.438
I mean, that you'd be slowing down.
That we'd be off this rat race.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.149
That we'd be traveling more
once Trey went off to college.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.485
- I changed my mind.
- When?

19:12.486 --> 19:15.738
When I realized I was about
to abandon the very thing

19:15.739 --> 19:18.991
that I took my entire adult life
trying to build.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.120
Is this why you didn't want us to write
that check to the Studio Museum today?

19:23.205 --> 19:26.541
That's why I married you, girl.
And I apologize for not telling you.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.709
I didn't even know for sure at that time.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.711
I tried to convince Patrick
to vote against it,

19:30.712 --> 19:33.256
but he just didn't have the vision.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.133
Where are we getting the money?

19:36.885 --> 19:39.262
That's the tricky part.
We'll take a loan out on the penthouse,

19:39.263 --> 19:43.140
and we can cash out on some of our
stocks and bonds and other investments.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.310
- Maybe sell off the Sag Harbor--
- Take a loan out on our home?

19:46.311 --> 19:48.104
You're gonna cash out our stocks and bonds

19:48.105 --> 19:50.815
for a record label
that barely breaks even.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.817
It's called the music business, baby.

19:52.818 --> 19:56.654
In the music business, you're always
one hit away from being back on top,

19:56.655 --> 19:59.657
and when I get controlling interest
of Stackin' Hits Records,

19:59.658 --> 20:01.909
we'll be back on top again.
I can guarantee you that.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.620
But maybe some things aren't meant
to go back to the way they were.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.915
- Maybe they can't.
- What's that supposed to mean?

20:07.875 --> 20:09.042
My darling...

20:10.836 --> 20:13.046
it just means...

20:14.339 --> 20:16.549
that maybe this whole thing is a sign

20:16.550 --> 20:19.761
that it's time to move on
to the next chapter of our lives.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.096
Maybe I don't wanna move on.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.891
It just feels like a risk.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.517
For us.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.811
Everything I've ever done,
accomplished in my life

20:28.812 --> 20:30.730
was involving taking risks. Even you.

20:30.731 --> 20:35.235
You think it wasn't risky for me when
I saw you across the room at that party

20:36.653 --> 20:40.698
and asked you if you wanted a drink?
You don't think that was a risk?

20:40.699 --> 20:42.575
You had just won a Grammy.

20:42.576 --> 20:48.456
It was your after-party and Quincy Jones
had just called you the future of music.

20:48.457 --> 20:51.460
But I was still nervous.
You know why I was nervous?

20:52.461 --> 20:54.630
That's because of how beautiful you were.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.425
You're still beautiful.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.513
Come on.

21:06.475 --> 21:08.893
- All right, answer me this.
- What?

21:08.894 --> 21:10.437
Do you still love it?

21:11.271 --> 21:14.983
- Hell yeah.
- I'm talking about the music, David.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.943
Of course I love it.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.111
You sure?

21:20.155 --> 21:22.741
Because I remember
when we first started dating,

21:24.409 --> 21:26.245
you would leave the studio downtown,

21:27.162 --> 21:28.664
you'd put your headphones on,

21:29.331 --> 21:33.501
and you would walk all the way over
the Brooklyn Bridge to my apartment,

21:33.502 --> 21:37.046
and I nearly broke up with you for it
because you made us late for everything,

21:37.047 --> 21:38.674
but I would always forgive you

21:39.883 --> 21:43.511
because you would show up so excited.

21:43.512 --> 21:48.767
I mean, beaming over some
new artist or a band you discovered.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.437
I mean, you don't do that anymore.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.316
And when you talk about your work, it's...

21:57.109 --> 21:59.694
It's always about how
the music business has changed,

21:59.695 --> 22:03.447
or how the Internet has made it hard
to stay on top of what works,

22:03.448 --> 22:08.328
but it is never ever about the music.

22:10.664 --> 22:14.501
And as your loving, silent partner,

22:16.378 --> 22:17.838
I will no longer be silent.

22:19.840 --> 22:21.925
I will always be loving and supportive,

22:23.302 --> 22:24.887
but I will no longer be silent.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.396
- Gonna answer that?
- Yeah. The phone?

22:35.397 --> 22:37.648
- I thought you meant--
- We'll talk more about this later.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.818
- All right. That's a promise.
- All right. Promise.

22:45.240 --> 22:46.325
Yes.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.095
Pam.

23:08.138 --> 23:09.556
Somebody's got Trey.

23:10.641 --> 23:13.142
- What do you mean somebody's got Trey?
- Somebody's got Trey.

23:13.143 --> 23:16.062
They... I think they kidnapped him.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.855
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.942
They said they'd call me back.
They said they want money. I...

23:20.943 --> 23:23.737
Paul! Paul!

23:25.155 --> 23:26.989
- They said they'd call back. Paul.
- What's the matter?

23:26.990 --> 23:29.951
Somebody's just called
and said they've kidnapped Trey.

23:29.952 --> 23:32.371
- What?
- See if you can get Kyle on the phone.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.498
Shoot.

23:35.499 --> 23:36.583
Hello?

23:37.960 --> 23:40.211
- Yeah.
- Damn. Straight to voicemail.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.256
David King, 30 Front Street.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.802
Somebody's kidnapped our son.

23:49.847 --> 23:53.267
Yes. King. Trey King. T-R-E... T-R...

23:54.977 --> 23:56.520
Yes. All right.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.649
Are you okay?

24:19.751 --> 24:20.961
Hang on.

24:24.715 --> 24:25.883
Coming. Coming.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.140
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. King.
I'm Detective Dillon.

24:33.640 --> 24:34.725
- Can I come in?
- Yes, please.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.726
You're welcome to set up in here.

24:36.727 --> 24:39.729
If you need to use the table, you can,
just move the candelabras out of the way.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.939
Maybe flowers to the left
of the fireplace.

24:41.940 --> 24:44.150
- That's all?
- Yes. You can bring them in.

24:44.151 --> 24:48.030
All right, come on in. We're gonna
set up over here in the dining room.

25:00.292 --> 25:02.043
Trey's a great kid.

25:02.044 --> 25:05.004
A young star.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.924
<i>Keeps his nose clean. On his grind.</i>

25:07.925 --> 25:12.136
Always there for my son, Kyle,
since his mother passed.

25:12.137 --> 25:13.305
My wife.

25:18.393 --> 25:20.812
- What can I tell you?
- How about the truth?

25:22.981 --> 25:24.608
Have we seen each other before somewhere?

25:25.692 --> 25:27.528
I don't know, maybe at Junior's.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.862
I like the cheesecake over there.

25:29.863 --> 25:32.282
Nah. That's not it.

25:37.746 --> 25:40.039
Mr. and Mrs. King, I'm Detective Bridges.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.916
I'm with the Major Case squad.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.710
I've been assigned to investigate
your son's abduction.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.754
Now, Detective Higgins told me

25:46.755 --> 25:49.549
that the kidnapper gave you
instructions on the phone?

25:49.550 --> 25:51.218
Right, right. Said...

25:52.678 --> 25:55.722
$17.5 million in Swiss francs.

25:56.265 --> 25:58.642
Unmarked 1,000...

26:02.020 --> 26:05.816
Sorry, he said 1,000-franc notes, and...

26:08.235 --> 26:11.779
- and he'd call us back tonight.
- That's it?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.866
- That's it. He hung up.
- They'll get it.

26:14.867 --> 26:18.494
Whatever they want.
As long as we get Trey back unharmed.

26:18.495 --> 26:20.580
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Right, David?

26:20.581 --> 26:25.168
- Yes, and--
- I need my baby boy home.

26:25.169 --> 26:28.297
- I certainly understand.
- Has anyone issued an Ebony Alert?

26:29.381 --> 26:31.048
Yeah, Ebony Alerts, David.

26:31.049 --> 26:33.593
They are a "system activated
on behalf of Black youth

26:33.594 --> 26:35.553
who are reported missing
under suspicious circumstances

26:35.554 --> 26:37.805
or may have been abducted."
It needs to happen.

26:37.806 --> 26:43.019
Respectfully, Mrs. King, we are
all aware of the Ebony Alert System.

26:43.020 --> 26:45.897
But, as of now,
it's not a law in New York State,

26:45.898 --> 26:50.943
but rest assured, we take Trey's
abduction and all kidnappings seriously.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.695
We will find your son.

26:52.696 --> 26:56.866
I scanned the photo of Trey and sent it
to Special Investigation Division.

26:56.867 --> 27:00.703
It's being forwarded to the Real Time
Crime Center for the Amber Alert

27:00.704 --> 27:03.206
and also to be distributed to patrol.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.291
Now...

27:05.167 --> 27:07.544
oftentimes, kidnapping is done

27:08.462 --> 27:12.632
by someone with an intimate knowledge
of the family.

27:12.633 --> 27:14.717
I ask you this just to see if--

27:14.718 --> 27:18.262
You trying to say that maybe
somebody in our house did this?

27:18.263 --> 27:20.640
Is that what you're trying to say?
I'm sorry.

27:20.641 --> 27:22.975
- No.
- There's nobody here like that.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.727
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

27:24.728 --> 27:29.398
I'm just trying to understand
the process of finding our son.

27:29.399 --> 27:32.818
Yes, and we are trying to find your son
as quickly as possible.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.113
- Thank you.
- We all want the same thing.

27:36.031 --> 27:37.823
With all due respect,

27:37.824 --> 27:40.953
I know a man of your stature
is not used to being told what to do,

27:41.745 --> 27:44.121
but we need you to trust us.

27:44.122 --> 27:46.583
And please, do as I say.

27:47.376 --> 27:48.794
For Trey's sake.

28:11.984 --> 28:15.278
Now, Mr. King, when the kidnapper calls,

28:15.279 --> 28:16.904
please remain calm.

28:16.905 --> 28:20.408
I know you have a lot of emotion,
but it's important to keep your composure

28:20.409 --> 28:21.618
on the call.

28:22.828 --> 28:23.871
I understand.

28:25.163 --> 28:28.374
- Personnel at LIU arena now.
- Hey, is Kyle there? My son.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.710
- Mr. Christopher, please.
- It's just, I tried calling him--

28:30.711 --> 28:33.546
Your boy's at the camp. There's a lot
going on over there right now.

28:33.547 --> 28:36.383
You're starting to bother me.
Let me do my fucking job, all right?

28:38.427 --> 28:40.053
He's a handsome young man.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.097
He's kind too.

28:44.057 --> 28:46.268
Have you noticed anything
different about him lately?

28:47.019 --> 28:49.187
Anything that may cause concern?

28:49.188 --> 28:50.855
Cause concern?

28:50.856 --> 28:54.817
He's at an age where he may
find his way into the wrong crowds.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.611
I remember how I was at 17.

28:56.612 --> 28:58.155
No, he's a great son.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.615
Trey is a smart young man.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.491
No one is saying he's not.

29:02.492 --> 29:03.785
Shit just got real.

29:05.454 --> 29:06.704
- Hey.
- Yeah.

29:06.705 --> 29:09.624
LIU personnel just found a green
headband outside the basketball arena.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.959
What? That's Trey's. That's Trey's, David.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.754
Higgins, contact Real Time
Crime Center at 1 Police Plaza

29:14.755 --> 29:17.965
and ascertain if there are any stills
or videos from the vicinity

29:17.966 --> 29:19.800
- of the LIU basketball arena.
- Right.

29:19.801 --> 29:24.681
Detective Bell, have all vehicles with
LPRs download their images right away.

29:25.807 --> 29:26.933
Mr. and Mrs. King,

29:26.934 --> 29:31.437
everything we see and recover
is to be considered leads or information

29:31.438 --> 29:34.649
until we can put all the pieces
of this puzzle together.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.442
- Can we...
- All right. Okay.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.612
- Got you.
- Thank you. Come on.

29:45.035 --> 29:46.328
I'll tell you what I know.

29:47.788 --> 29:50.414
- We're listening.
- I had the kids running suicides...

29:50.415 --> 29:52.875
- All right!
- <i>...and I saw Trey was limping.</i>

29:52.876 --> 29:55.003
There ain't no time to be hurt. Let's go.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.840
So I told him to sit out,
and ice his ankle.

29:58.841 --> 30:01.092
- Stretch that out, stretch that out.
- Yeah.

30:01.093 --> 30:04.721
- Did you see him after that?
- Officer, I got a hundred kids here.

30:05.389 --> 30:07.807
I mean,
he may have snuck out before lunch.

30:07.808 --> 30:09.851
- Fair enough.
- Is Trey okay?

30:09.852 --> 30:11.477
As far as we know.

30:11.478 --> 30:13.271
And Kyle's okay too?

30:13.272 --> 30:15.106
We have no reason to believe he's not.

30:15.107 --> 30:16.774
Okay.

30:16.775 --> 30:18.985
- Look, let me give you my number.
- Sure.

30:18.986 --> 30:21.988
In the event you hear anything,
please let me know.

30:21.989 --> 30:24.240
We're just gathering information
right now, Coach, all right?

30:24.241 --> 30:26.242
Coach Fox, I'm a huge fan.

30:26.243 --> 30:27.869
Would you mind also an autograph?

30:27.870 --> 30:29.412
If it's not too much to ask.

30:29.413 --> 30:32.374
- Yeah, sure thing, Officer Bolton.
- Bolton.

30:33.166 --> 30:35.042
Officer McGillicuddy, you want one?

30:35.043 --> 30:37.129
- Nah, I'm good.
- Celtics fan.

30:38.213 --> 30:39.214
Yeah, that figures.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.717
- Thank you. Enjoy your day, Coach.
- Thank you.

30:42.718 --> 30:44.010
Please, let me know of anything.

30:44.011 --> 30:46.137
- We'll keep you in the loop, Coach.
- All right.

30:46.138 --> 30:47.264
Larry Bird.

30:49.433 --> 30:50.475
Yeah.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.939
<i>And in breaking news,</i>

30:56.940 --> 31:00.359
<i>NYPD sources confirmed that Trey King,</i>

31:00.360 --> 31:04.572
<i>the 17-year-old son of Stackin' Hits
Records founder, David King,</i>

31:04.573 --> 31:06.115
<i>has been kidnapped.</i>

31:06.116 --> 31:08.659
<i>You all know David King
as founder and the brainchild</i>

31:08.660 --> 31:13.206
<i>behind Stackin' Hits Records's
decades-long dominance in the early 2000s.</i>

31:13.207 --> 31:15.917
<i>Although not the "King-maker" he once was,</i>

31:15.918 --> 31:17.919
<i>David is still the man with the plan,</i>

31:17.920 --> 31:20.963
<i>known to be blessed
with the best ears in the business.</i>

31:20.964 --> 31:24.592
<i>He has worked to guide and develop
over 50 Grammy winners.</i>

31:24.593 --> 31:28.179
<i>The Bronx native has always been known
as a devoted family man</i>

31:28.180 --> 31:29.847
<i>and philanthropist.</i>

31:29.848 --> 31:32.934
<i>So the outpouring of love and support
is not a surprise</i>

31:32.935 --> 31:35.228
<i>during this unfortunate situation.</i>

31:35.229 --> 31:37.188
<i>Let's all send our prayers</i>

31:37.189 --> 31:41.068
<i>for the safe return of our young brother,
Trey King.</i>

31:48.951 --> 31:50.159
We through?

31:50.160 --> 31:52.496
I don't know. Are we?

31:53.705 --> 31:55.957
Detective, I'm gonna go look for my son.

31:55.958 --> 31:59.585
We don't think that'd be in the best
interest for everyone involved.

31:59.586 --> 32:02.296
- "We"?
- Yes. We.

32:02.297 --> 32:03.382
Are we his father?

32:04.258 --> 32:07.343
You can't stop me from trying
to find my son. Am I under arrest?

32:07.344 --> 32:10.680
- No. Should you be?
- Should you be?

32:10.681 --> 32:12.975
Mr. Christopher,
we know your parole officer.

32:13.851 --> 32:15.268
You don't want us to make that call.

32:15.269 --> 32:17.144
You got his number?
I'm off parole. Call him.

32:17.145 --> 32:20.147
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Give it a rest, would you? Sit down.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.691
Pretty please?

32:21.692 --> 32:23.402
You give my dick a rest.

32:26.655 --> 32:29.156
We are wondering
why you haven't heard from Kyle.

32:29.157 --> 32:32.035
- "We"? Are you French?
- <i>Oui, oui.</i>

32:34.705 --> 32:37.081
<i>There's an enormous outpouring of love...</i>

32:37.082 --> 32:39.376
Hang on. Who's that?

32:40.252 --> 32:42.211
- It's Paul.
- Oh, come on in.

32:42.212 --> 32:43.422
<i>All vic--</i>

32:47.384 --> 32:48.427
Vultures.

32:49.845 --> 32:52.973
Turning you and Pam's private issue
into a circus.

32:53.849 --> 32:55.100
Come on, sit down.

32:56.476 --> 32:59.271
It's the deal I made, Paul. I don't mind
complaining about it when...

33:01.315 --> 33:04.234
when we're popping that Cristal,
and... you know.

33:05.861 --> 33:07.571
I made a call uptown.

33:09.198 --> 33:10.406
And?

33:10.407 --> 33:12.825
Just to see if the streets heard anything,
that's all. Can't hurt.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.161
I understand.

33:15.245 --> 33:18.332
- Don't do nothing stupid now.
- I'm cool like Herc.

33:21.335 --> 33:22.461
You cool like who?

33:24.296 --> 33:27.131
See that's why I love you, boy.
Man, I appreciate you.

33:27.132 --> 33:28.382
You know that.

33:28.383 --> 33:31.177
- Anything else you need from me?
- Not right now.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.929
- It's nothing, King.
- I know.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.932
After everything you've done for Kyle
and me, all the time I've spent with Trey,

33:35.933 --> 33:38.017
this family,
it's like my own son is missing.

33:38.018 --> 33:40.061
I'd do anything to get him back,
you understand?

33:40.062 --> 33:42.231
- I overstand.
- David!

33:43.106 --> 33:44.524
David! David!

33:44.525 --> 33:47.443
- Yeah?
- David! Baby, baby, they found him!

33:47.444 --> 33:48.695
They found him.

33:49.780 --> 33:52.908
They found him
and they're bringing him home.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.412
Oh, God, thank you.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.791
- Thank you!
- Our young men are safe.

34:03.126 --> 34:04.419
Kool Herc.

34:05.379 --> 34:07.630
- Kool Herc. I told you. I told you.
- Kool Herc.

34:07.631 --> 34:09.048
I told you.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.466
- I told you.
- Yeah, you did.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.552
You did. You did, brother.

34:12.553 --> 34:13.929
You sure did.

34:41.331 --> 34:43.291
- Where is he?
- Kyle!

34:43.292 --> 34:45.584
Where is he? Where is my son? Trey!

34:45.585 --> 34:46.879
Trey, my...

34:48.213 --> 34:50.007
Trey! My baby!

34:51.132 --> 34:53.426
My baby. My son.

34:53.427 --> 34:56.721
Oh, my God! Thank you, God. Thank you.

34:56.722 --> 34:59.098
- Trey, where's Kyle?
- Baby, let me look at you.

34:59.099 --> 35:00.766
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God. Why?

35:00.767 --> 35:03.644
- Where's my son? Where's Kyle?
- I'm so sorry.

35:03.645 --> 35:05.813
- What's up? Trey?
- I'm so sorry.

35:05.814 --> 35:07.899
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Christopher, there was a mix-up.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.484
- Where's Kyle?
- There was a mix-up.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.737
A mix-up? What are you talking about?
Where's my son?

35:12.738 --> 35:14.280
- The kidnapper has him.
- King!

35:14.281 --> 35:16.324
- Hold on!
- He grabbed Kyle by mistake.

35:16.325 --> 35:17.408
Wait, no, no, no, no--

35:17.409 --> 35:20.120
Trey said Kyle was wearing his headband
when they left the gym.

35:21.705 --> 35:23.539
We think the kidnapper got them confused.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.417
Confused? Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Wait, wait, wait.

35:26.418 --> 35:28.085
- Trey!
- Mr. Christopher--

35:28.086 --> 35:29.879
- Get the fuck--
- What's going on?

35:29.880 --> 35:32.798
- What's going on? Am I being detained?
- Back off. Back off.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.301
- Am I being detained?
- No, you are not being detained!

35:35.302 --> 35:37.261
- Name a statute!
- No, Mr. Christopher--

35:37.262 --> 35:39.639
- Am I being detained?
- I ain't naming no goddamn statute!

35:39.640 --> 35:41.015
No, Mr. Christopher,

35:41.016 --> 35:43.560
- you are not being detained!
- Correct!

35:44.394 --> 35:46.688
Let him go. Let him go. Let his ass go.

35:49.942 --> 35:51.276
Motherfuckers.

35:58.617 --> 36:01.870
Kyle and I,
we hate those lunches at the camp, so...

36:03.163 --> 36:04.872
we snuck out to grab something to eat.

36:04.873 --> 36:08.584
I wanted pizza, he wanted
his chopped cheese at the bodega.

36:08.585 --> 36:09.795
I said bet.

36:10.796 --> 36:14.090
You know, "I'll grab my slice
and meet you back here."

36:14.091 --> 36:16.677
- So you split up?
- Yeah.

36:17.761 --> 36:20.346
When I went back to the bodega, I was...

36:20.347 --> 36:22.223
I was waiting for him for a while.

36:22.224 --> 36:24.267
I went back in, I didn't see him.
He was gone.

36:24.268 --> 36:25.853
Why didn't you tell somebody?

36:26.812 --> 36:28.479
I thought he'd come back.

36:28.480 --> 36:31.023
I mean, we didn't have our phones, I...

36:31.024 --> 36:33.442
- You waited 30 minutes?
- I didn't wanna leave him.

36:33.443 --> 36:35.403
- I didn't know what to do.
- It's okay.

36:35.404 --> 36:37.989
I didn't even know that any of this
was gonna be a thing.

36:37.990 --> 36:39.657
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Yeah.

36:39.658 --> 36:43.077
- He's gonna be okay.
- Pam, maybe that's enough.

36:43.078 --> 36:45.830
- I think it is too.
- Why don't we take a break?

36:45.831 --> 36:47.623
Hold up.
Trey, you didn't see anything else?

36:47.624 --> 36:50.209
- Paul, he said that's good for tonight.
- Finish up another time.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.837
Mr. Christopher,
we have his initial statement.

36:52.838 --> 36:55.506
- We can work off that.
- How? Where is my son?

36:55.507 --> 36:58.050
- We are looking for your son.
- I need a minute.

36:58.051 --> 36:59.969
- Come on, man. Come on, man.
- Hold on.

36:59.970 --> 37:03.848
I swear on my wife's...
I swear on my wife's grave!

37:03.849 --> 37:06.142
- Swear on my wife's grave!
- Yo!

37:06.143 --> 37:07.728
Outta here, man.

37:10.689 --> 37:12.065
How you feeling?

37:13.567 --> 37:14.693
Truthfully.

37:17.446 --> 37:18.488
I don't know.

37:19.198 --> 37:20.240
That's fair.

37:21.158 --> 37:22.784
If you need anything, you call us, okay?

37:23.493 --> 37:25.078
- I love you guys.
- All right, son.

37:28.665 --> 37:29.916
Is Kyle gonna be okay?

37:29.917 --> 37:31.709
Hope so.

37:31.710 --> 37:33.669
But, like, if something happens, we're...

37:33.670 --> 37:36.256
we're gonna pay the ransom. Right?

37:36.840 --> 37:39.926
Well, there's a lot of good people
working very hard on this case

37:39.927 --> 37:41.636
to make sure that that doesn't happen.

37:41.637 --> 37:42.970
But you...

37:42.971 --> 37:46.307
Baby, you don't need to concern yourself
with any of that. You just rest up, okay?

37:46.308 --> 37:49.645
I mean, if we're his only chance.

37:50.229 --> 37:52.731
Mr. and Mrs. King, come on down!
The phone!

37:56.818 --> 38:00.239
Come on! Come on down.

38:01.198 --> 38:04.200
All right, it's still ringing.
Okay, get some chairs, get some chairs.

38:04.201 --> 38:06.327
Okay, listen to me, listen very carefully.

38:06.328 --> 38:08.079
Keep him talking, so speak slowly,

38:08.080 --> 38:10.581
stay focused, engage him in conversation.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.750
He may slip up, give us the break we need.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.669
He need to know he got the wrong kid.

38:14.670 --> 38:16.963
Well, to the kidnappers,
this is strictly business.

38:16.964 --> 38:19.215
They have something you want
and they want you to pay for it.

38:19.216 --> 38:21.676
- Let him know, King.
- Mr. King, the phone, please.

38:21.677 --> 38:23.469
Answer the phone, please.

38:23.470 --> 38:27.140
Okay. Relax.

38:27.891 --> 38:28.933
Hello.

38:28.934 --> 38:31.894
<i>King David. Now ain't this something?</i>

38:31.895 --> 38:34.230
- Sorry?
- <i>I got your full attention now, huh?</i>

38:34.231 --> 38:35.898
<i>You finally listening to me.</i>

38:35.899 --> 38:37.567
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- <i>Good.</i>

38:37.568 --> 38:40.403
- You know you got the wrong boy, right?
- <i>Yeah, so I've heard.</i>

38:40.404 --> 38:42.823
<i>And I also learned
you can never trust the help.</i>

38:43.657 --> 38:44.866
<i>But luckily for me,</i>

38:44.867 --> 38:47.368
<i>it was never about the boy,
it was always about you.</i>

38:47.369 --> 38:49.245
Well, fair enough, but if it's about me,

38:49.246 --> 38:52.248
then you can't expect me
to pay $17.5 million

38:52.249 --> 38:54.458
for somebody else's son if it's about me.

38:54.459 --> 38:56.961
<i>Well, then, his blood
is gonna be on your hands then.</i>

38:56.962 --> 39:00.131
- <i>How you want it?</i>
- Nah, man. Come on now.

39:00.132 --> 39:03.594
<i>Nigga, this ain't no fucking negotiation.
This a day of reckoning.</i>

39:04.386 --> 39:07.722
- <i>You not God no more, nigga, I am!</i>
- All right, listen.

39:07.723 --> 39:10.766
God give you everything you want, right?
No, God give you everything you need.

39:10.767 --> 39:13.186
So, the question is, what do you need?
How can I help you?

39:13.187 --> 39:15.564
Ain't saying I'm God, but I could help.

39:16.356 --> 39:19.150
- <i>You can help me? Nah.</i>
- I can. I... Yeah, you ain't listening.

39:19.151 --> 39:20.902
<i>Nah. It's quiet.</i>

39:20.903 --> 39:22.820
- <i>It's late for all that, bro.</i>
- Listen to me.

39:22.821 --> 39:25.698
You let him go,
I'll make sure you're set free.

39:25.699 --> 39:28.284
<i>Get the fuck outta here.
Who you think you talking to?</i>

39:28.285 --> 39:30.912
I can.
I got it like that in this town, baby boy.

39:30.913 --> 39:33.289
I hit you off, you can start over.

39:33.290 --> 39:35.791
- You could start over.
- <i>It's too late for all that.</i>

39:35.792 --> 39:38.503
- It's never too late. Aight, listen.
- <i>And you know what?</i>

39:38.504 --> 39:42.048
<i>Check this out, right?
17.5 million fucking dollars</i>

39:42.049 --> 39:45.801
<i>in 1,000-Swiss-franc notes
in an old black Jordan backpack,</i>

39:45.802 --> 39:49.055
or this little nigga dead and stinking.
Try me if you think I'm playing.

39:49.056 --> 39:53.017
Brother, it's not my son, goddamn it.
Help a nigga, man.

39:53.018 --> 39:55.895
I'll hit you tomorrow with the
drop-off details in the mornin', pussy!

39:55.896 --> 39:57.397
I ain't got--

40:00.692 --> 40:01.777
Pussy!

40:06.073 --> 40:08.491
- Can you trace that?
- Burners can't be traced.

40:08.492 --> 40:11.118
- Why not?
- They have no unique identifiers...

40:11.119 --> 40:12.578
- Y'all can't trace that?
- ...no SIM card.

40:12.579 --> 40:14.247
It's 2025, y'all ain't got...

40:14.248 --> 40:16.833
I mean, shit, y'all watch <i>SUV</i>.
What the fuck?

40:16.834 --> 40:18.877
Fuck outta here.

40:32.599 --> 40:36.561
Can one of y'all tell me why this asshole
wants Swiss francs as the ransom?

40:36.562 --> 40:38.563
It beats the hell out of me.
I couldn't tell ya.

40:38.564 --> 40:43.359
Hey. Hey, fellas.
Before I was transferred to Major Case,

40:43.360 --> 40:45.362
I was assigned to O.C.C.B.

40:46.071 --> 40:48.114
Asset forfeiture, money laundering.

40:48.115 --> 40:50.116
It's all about the size.

40:50.117 --> 40:54.996
The package will only weigh around
35 pounds in 1,000-Swiss-franc notes,

40:54.997 --> 40:59.792
as opposed to 385 pounds in US $100 bills.

40:59.793 --> 41:04.172
How's Mr. King gonna make the drop
lugging a 385-pound backpack? He can't.

41:04.173 --> 41:08.676
A 1,000-Swiss-franc note
is the equivalent value of ten $100 bills.

41:08.677 --> 41:10.761
Damn, sister,
where'd you go to college at, huh?

41:10.762 --> 41:13.891
Spelman College. Black woman excellence.

41:18.896 --> 41:20.856
- Yeah?
- Paul.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.275
Come on in. Come on in, man.

41:31.533 --> 41:32.534
Can...

41:33.660 --> 41:35.746
- Can we talk?
- Of course.

41:39.791 --> 41:42.503
You've never been a good liar, Paul,
so let's get right to it.

41:43.754 --> 41:47.257
He threatened to kill Kyle, right?

41:49.676 --> 41:51.344
He'll kill my son,
that's what he said, right?

41:51.345 --> 41:54.222
You know how hard I been trying.

41:54.223 --> 41:55.431
He's all I got.

41:55.432 --> 41:57.099
I got nothing, just me and him.

41:57.100 --> 42:00.520
Look, man, they want $17.5 million.

42:00.521 --> 42:04.190
That cop, Bridges, said we can get
the money back. I swear on my life...

42:04.191 --> 42:06.527
I swear on my life, King,
it's just a loan.

42:09.404 --> 42:12.073
What... You mean,
you gonna pay back the loan?

42:12.074 --> 42:13.491
I'll make it up to you, inshallah.

42:13.492 --> 42:16.953
Where you gonna get the money from?
You ain't never seen no $17.5 million.

42:16.954 --> 42:19.830
You can't even count to 17.5.
Forget the million part.

42:19.831 --> 42:21.834
- I'll make it happen, inshallah.
- How?

42:24.920 --> 42:26.003
You don't...

42:26.004 --> 42:29.966
You don't feel
any kind of responsibility here?

42:29.967 --> 42:32.343
For what? A kidnapper's mistake?

42:32.344 --> 42:35.805
They didn't want Kyle, they wanted Trey.
It had nothing to do with me.

42:35.806 --> 42:38.391
They wanted your son to come after you.

42:38.392 --> 42:41.811
They don't even want my son, they want me.
And they want me,

42:41.812 --> 42:45.357
and you expect me to pay
for some kidnapper's mistake.

42:48.151 --> 42:49.402
I don't do that.

42:49.403 --> 42:51.446
You were gonna work it out for Trey.

42:54.700 --> 42:55.784
Yeah, I was.

42:58.745 --> 43:00.079
Tell me how I can make this work.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.373
- Stackin' Hits.
- What about it?

43:02.374 --> 43:04.876
- I know all the deals, King.
- What deals?

43:04.877 --> 43:08.337
I'm no Warren Buffett, but I know there's
enough money on the table to make it work.

43:08.338 --> 43:09.505
You ever look under the table?

43:09.506 --> 43:11.174
See, don't nobody look under the table.

43:11.175 --> 43:13.843
Everybody looks on top of the table,
that's what they see.

43:13.844 --> 43:17.054
You countin' my money, now count it all.
Don't raise up on me, Paul.

43:17.055 --> 43:19.599
You know how much people owe me?
You know how many people I pay?

43:19.600 --> 43:21.267
Do you know what my taxes are?
Do you know--

43:21.268 --> 43:23.729
Listen, listen, beloved, I see all you do.

43:24.438 --> 43:28.107
And I can never stop thanking you
for what you did for me.

43:28.108 --> 43:30.026
But I never really asked you for anything.

43:30.027 --> 43:31.986
- You never had to, Paul.
- That's right, that's right.

43:31.987 --> 43:34.281
You gave it to me freely.
I love you for that.

43:34.948 --> 43:38.201
Right now, I'm asking you for everything.

43:38.202 --> 43:41.037
- I'm asking you for my life.
- Nah, you ain't asking me for life.

43:41.038 --> 43:43.372
Right now,
you asking me for $17.5 million.

43:43.373 --> 43:45.500
That's all people do is ask me for stuff.

43:45.501 --> 43:47.752
- "Can you give me this?"
- Help my son. That's my son, too.

43:47.753 --> 43:50.505
They just want me to pay.
"Stack hits. Pay for this.

43:50.506 --> 43:52.507
Give me that. Give me this.

43:52.508 --> 43:55.510
Put this on top of that, on top of this,
on top of that, on top of this,

43:55.511 --> 43:57.095
on top of that, and this, and that."

44:02.100 --> 44:03.268
You see this?

44:06.522 --> 44:10.025
I thought about blowing
this motherfucker up many times.

44:11.735 --> 44:13.445
I couldn't find the power.

44:17.533 --> 44:18.784
That's what I got, man.

44:19.868 --> 44:22.037
See if there's anything for you in there.

44:57.781 --> 44:58.991
I got it. I got it.

45:06.832 --> 45:10.710
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. King.
I have a Mr. Bethea downstairs to see you.

45:10.711 --> 45:13.671
He says he called a couple of times
and no response, so he sent me up.

45:13.672 --> 45:14.756
Okay.

45:20.637 --> 45:22.639
How's Trey? Pam?

45:23.640 --> 45:26.017
Good as to be expected
under the circumstances.

45:26.018 --> 45:28.269
I mean,
the kidnapper still wants the ransom.

45:28.270 --> 45:32.398
Says if I don't pay he's gonna
kill Paul's son if I don't pay up.

45:32.399 --> 45:34.942
$17.5 million mix-up.

45:34.943 --> 45:37.196
- He still wants you to pay?
- Yeah.

45:39.489 --> 45:41.158
And I don't think I can.

45:42.743 --> 45:44.328
David, how can you not pay?

45:45.996 --> 45:47.788
I pay, number one, our deal is dead.

45:47.789 --> 45:50.416
I still have to sell off Stackin' Hits.
That's too much to ask.

45:50.417 --> 45:52.502
I don't see that you have
much of a choice.

45:52.503 --> 45:54.505
Yeah, I got a choice. It's my money.

45:56.131 --> 45:58.633
What are people gonna say
when you sacrifice Paul's kid

45:58.634 --> 46:00.302
to buy Stackin' Hits back?

46:05.974 --> 46:09.770
- I don't know. Shit's complicated.
- Shit.

46:10.479 --> 46:14.191
Complexity doesn't matter
to John Q. Public, the masses.

46:15.442 --> 46:17.485
You see how it is
when an artist is canceled.

46:17.486 --> 46:19.779
- Yeah.
- When social media finds out,

46:19.780 --> 46:22.073
and you can bet your bottom dollar
they will find out

46:22.074 --> 46:24.408
that you abandoned Paul's son,

46:24.409 --> 46:26.994
that's the whole label. The whole shebang.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.289
The kit and caboodle. That's it.

46:30.165 --> 46:32.083
You will be done and finished.

46:32.084 --> 46:35.002
Over and out. Canceled. End of story.

46:35.003 --> 46:38.005
- We don't know that for sure.
- We don't? You sure about that?

46:38.006 --> 46:40.759
I mean, you're right, I mean, but...

46:43.095 --> 46:45.305
I can't even believe
I'm gonna say this, but...

46:46.974 --> 46:50.476
You know how things move so fast
right now in the news.

46:50.477 --> 46:52.937
I mean, they'll be onto
something else next week.

46:52.938 --> 46:55.189
- It'll be another news cycle.
- David.

46:55.190 --> 46:56.816
A story about another war...

46:56.817 --> 46:59.486
- What?
- Do you hear what you're saying?

47:01.905 --> 47:05.658
Yeah. I mean, I know what it sounds like,
but I'm just trying to be practical.

47:05.659 --> 47:07.369
Is that the chance you wanna take?

47:08.203 --> 47:10.455
I just wanna see you do what's right.

47:15.878 --> 47:17.212
Thank you.

47:19.590 --> 47:21.091
- Get some sleep.
- Yeah.

47:25.429 --> 47:30.851
What do you think people will say
if we don't pay the ransom?

47:33.187 --> 47:37.107
I think the important people in our life
will understand the decision we make.

47:38.066 --> 47:39.568
But what about the public?

47:41.153 --> 47:42.862
Patrick says if we don't pay,

47:42.863 --> 47:47.326
the backlash will ruin
what's left of my career.

47:48.911 --> 47:50.579
Well, I guess that settles it then.

47:51.246 --> 47:52.456
What do you mean?

47:53.248 --> 47:56.125
Earlier today you were ready to risk
your family's security for Stackin' Hits.

47:56.126 --> 47:57.543
Why should this be any different?

47:57.544 --> 47:59.837
Yeah, but now this has
got nothing to do with earlier.

47:59.838 --> 48:02.006
Now, it's all intertwined. It's everybody.

48:02.007 --> 48:04.091
It's you. It's Stackin' Hits.

48:04.092 --> 48:07.261
It's... Kyle, Trey, Paul.

48:07.262 --> 48:09.014
David, it's so much money.

48:10.474 --> 48:12.517
It's practically everything
we have, isn't it?

48:12.518 --> 48:14.228
It's close.

48:19.107 --> 48:20.358
So, what should we do?

48:20.359 --> 48:22.026
I don't know.

48:22.027 --> 48:23.362
Me either.

48:25.113 --> 48:27.741
Whatever it is,
we have to figure it out together, yeah?

48:31.328 --> 48:32.621
How's Trey doing?

48:33.247 --> 48:34.330
He's asking for you.

48:34.331 --> 48:35.791
- Has he been?
- Yeah.

48:42.756 --> 48:44.091
Love you.

49:02.985 --> 49:04.152
Trey.

49:17.749 --> 49:18.876
There you go.

49:22.796 --> 49:24.256
How you feeling, champ?

49:25.090 --> 49:26.341
Like a chump.

49:30.137 --> 49:32.096
Please don't tell Mom,
but my ankle's kinda sore

49:32.097 --> 49:34.474
from doing suicides up and down the court.

49:35.642 --> 49:37.144
It's not serious, it's just...

49:37.811 --> 49:39.270
It's bothering me a little bit.

49:39.271 --> 49:41.190
I'll keep that between you and me.

49:42.274 --> 49:45.736
And I wanna apologize for...

49:47.196 --> 49:51.574
telling you that I was gonna stay
and watch you ball out and then leaving.

49:51.575 --> 49:54.827
- Yeah, that doesn't matter now.
- No, it does matter. It does matter.

49:54.828 --> 49:59.583
I just want you to know that
everything I do, everything I do,

50:00.542 --> 50:02.711
I do for you...

50:04.588 --> 50:06.924
for your mother, for us.

50:08.842 --> 50:10.010
Family first.

50:13.138 --> 50:16.350
Not paying the ransom for Kyle
is what's best for everyone?

50:17.643 --> 50:19.394
For me, Mom, Uncle Paul?

50:21.605 --> 50:23.439
How does that work, Dad?

50:23.440 --> 50:25.608
Well, it's hard to understand now,

50:25.609 --> 50:28.819
but it's not quite that easy.

50:28.820 --> 50:30.405
It's more complicated than that.

50:31.448 --> 50:34.492
But Uncle Paul was right.
We're the ones to blame.

50:34.493 --> 50:36.410
That's not true.
We're not the ones to blame--

50:36.411 --> 50:40.082
It's not just Uncle Paul.

50:41.959 --> 50:46.170
Front page of the <i>New York Daily News</i>,
<i>The New York Post</i>.

50:46.171 --> 50:50.842
I mean, social media,
TikTok, IG, voice mail, stuff online.

50:50.843 --> 50:53.636
I'm getting DMs like I should've
been the one that got snatched.

50:53.637 --> 50:56.138
- Son, I told you--
- Dad, you don't understand.

50:56.139 --> 50:58.808
<i>Media Take Out</i>,
Black Twitter is doggin' me out, I--

50:58.809 --> 51:02.311
You got... You can't listen
to that nonsense. That's poison.

51:02.312 --> 51:04.481
- That's garbage.
- Dad, it's everywhere.

51:05.649 --> 51:06.899
You don't understand.

51:06.900 --> 51:10.278
This is not just a bad <i>Rolling Stone</i>
album review that you can just look over.

51:10.279 --> 51:12.155
You still gotta ignore it.

51:12.781 --> 51:14.616
I can't ignore it.

51:19.079 --> 51:22.498
My friends are gonna think I'm the reason
my best friend was murdered in cold blood.

51:22.499 --> 51:24.751
- Oh, come on, son.
- You know what that means?

51:25.794 --> 51:28.129
I mean, how can I go back
and finish high school?

51:28.130 --> 51:30.090
What colleges are gonna accept me, Dad?

51:36.763 --> 51:38.348
We gotta think of something.

51:39.433 --> 51:40.976
We gotta think of something.

51:43.061 --> 51:45.188
We have to think of something.

51:45.189 --> 51:46.732
All right, I...

51:49.943 --> 51:51.235
I don't know, son.

51:51.236 --> 51:53.988
- What do you mean you don't know?
- I just... Right now...

51:53.989 --> 51:57.575
- You know everything and everybody.
- I just... Yeah, but right now, I just...

51:57.576 --> 52:01.705
No, no, Daddy, you do know!
Pay the fucking 17.5 million!

52:02.623 --> 52:04.249
It's just fucking money!

52:08.420 --> 52:10.838
So, you're gonna curse
at your father like that?

52:10.839 --> 52:12.591
You're gonna disrespect me like that?

52:13.300 --> 52:14.510
In my own house.

52:15.761 --> 52:16.803
I see.

52:18.138 --> 52:19.890
Now, don't get it twisted, son.

52:24.186 --> 52:27.105
There's only one man in this house,
and you're looking at him.

52:30.984 --> 52:33.277
You ever talk to me like that again,

52:33.278 --> 52:36.155
and I'll bust your little narrow,
no-rent-paying ass.

52:36.156 --> 52:37.449
You understand me?

52:40.869 --> 52:42.411
I'ma say it again.

52:42.412 --> 52:43.789
Do you hear me?

52:46.875 --> 52:48.377
- I hear you.
- Do you?

52:49.962 --> 52:50.963
Yes, sir.

52:52.381 --> 52:53.423
Do you?

52:54.758 --> 52:56.552
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

52:58.929 --> 53:00.347
David King.

53:02.057 --> 53:05.143
My father, the man with
the best ears in the business...

53:09.106 --> 53:10.482
but the coldest heart.

53:28.584 --> 53:30.377
I gotta get this door fixed.

54:40.489 --> 54:42.573
What would you do, James?

54:42.574 --> 54:44.451
What would you do, Stevie?

54:46.286 --> 54:47.496
Jimi?

54:48.247 --> 54:50.582
Aretha, what would you do?

54:58.882 --> 55:00.508
What you gonna do about it?

55:00.509 --> 55:01.676
I don't know.

55:01.677 --> 55:02.802
Well, figure it out.

55:02.803 --> 55:04.263
I'm trying, man.

55:05.222 --> 55:06.473
I've lost my son.

55:07.182 --> 55:08.559
What do I tell him, huh?

55:09.852 --> 55:12.980
What do I tell him? Y'all talk to
each other, 'cause I can't talk to him.

55:13.730 --> 55:17.150
Oh, my son. Oh, man.

55:18.360 --> 55:19.528
I'm sorry.

55:21.280 --> 55:22.948
Yeah. Hang on. Hang on.

55:26.994 --> 55:28.412
Yeah, come in.

55:30.122 --> 55:31.163
Sorry. Yes?

55:31.164 --> 55:34.501
- Summer cold.
- How you holding up?

55:40.090 --> 55:41.716
- You all right?
- Wow.

55:41.717 --> 55:43.926
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I hear you.

55:43.927 --> 55:45.012
How can I help you, boy?

55:45.721 --> 55:47.513
We've been going over plans for tomorrow.

55:47.514 --> 55:49.725
- Yeah?
- Yeah, and...

55:51.018 --> 55:54.813
You think you'd be okay with telling
the kidnapper you will pay the ransom?

56:01.361 --> 56:03.155
It would buy us more time.

56:26.261 --> 56:27.888
It's all right. Okay.

56:28.764 --> 56:29.932
Keep negotiating.

56:30.849 --> 56:32.434
Will do. Thank you.

56:33.894 --> 56:35.812
"Will do. Thank you."

56:49.993 --> 56:51.328
Paul.

56:52.955 --> 56:54.039
Paul.

56:57.626 --> 56:58.752
Go on, Trey.

57:00.379 --> 57:02.463
We gonna pay. We gonna pay the ransom.

57:02.464 --> 57:04.466
Speak up, son. What'd you say?

57:05.300 --> 57:07.594
We're gonna pay the ransom, Uncle Paul.

57:08.595 --> 57:09.679
You serious?

57:09.680 --> 57:11.849
Serious as prediabetes.

57:17.479 --> 57:19.438
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:19.439 --> 57:22.484
Bless you.

57:23.026 --> 57:24.569
Let me get in here.

57:24.570 --> 57:25.654
Bless you.

57:27.614 --> 57:28.699
Detective.

57:29.867 --> 57:31.159
Tomorrow morning...

57:31.785 --> 57:34.537
I'ma go to the bank...

57:34.538 --> 57:37.999
and... see what we can do.

57:38.000 --> 57:39.542
- All right.
- Anything else?

57:39.543 --> 57:41.419
Nah, we good. Yeah.

57:41.420 --> 57:43.005
We train for situations like this.

57:43.964 --> 57:45.507
We gonna bring Kyle home.

57:46.425 --> 57:48.134
And your ransom.

57:48.135 --> 57:51.220
All right, let's all get some shut-eye.
We gonna need it.

57:51.221 --> 57:52.471
Yeah.

57:52.472 --> 57:54.056
- Good night.
- Good night.

57:54.057 --> 57:55.184
Let's do this.

01:00:29.213 --> 01:00:30.214
Hello?

01:00:31.048 --> 01:00:32.882
<i>Yo. You got the chicken?</i>

01:00:32.883 --> 01:00:34.717
How you want it? Baked, fried or jerked?

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.969
<i>Ain't no time
for no corny-ass jokes and shit.</i>

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.097
<i>You know what the fuck I'm talking about,
the ransom money. Where it at?</i>

01:00:40.098 --> 01:00:41.599
- Yes, I have it.
- <i>Fo' sho.</i>

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:45.186
<i>Now, 11:00 a.m.,
board the 4 train at Borough Hall</i>

01:00:45.187 --> 01:00:46.979
<i>going to money-making Manhattan.</i>

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.525
<i>First car. Take your phone with you,
I'll text you the directions.</i>

01:00:50.526 --> 01:00:52.902
What about Kyle? I need to see Kyle first.

01:00:52.903 --> 01:00:55.154
<i>You will, you will, in due time.</i>

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:56.822
<i>Be easy, B.</i>

01:00:56.823 --> 01:00:58.366
<i>Oh, and by the way,</i>

01:00:58.367 --> 01:01:01.786
<i>I want you to throw your wifey
Cartier bracelet in with the loot as well.</i>

01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:03.246
How do you know about that?

01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:06.916
<i>'Cause she always flexing it online.
You know your wifey like to flaunt, right?</i>

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.669
<i>Showing off at the Grammys
on the red carpet.</i>

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.296
<i>Ain't shit private
no more these days, David.</i>

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:13.881
Can't do that. Can't do that, B.

01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:15.633
Come on, man. I'll pay you the money.

01:01:15.634 --> 01:01:17.386
I'll pay the ransom, but that's a...

01:01:18.512 --> 01:01:21.264
15th-wedding-anniversary gift, man.
That's from my heart.

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:23.015
<i>You ain't in control no more, nigga!</i>

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:24.934
<i>Ain't running this shit, nigga, I am!</i>

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:26.979
<i>Old-ass, pussy-ass nigga!</i>

01:01:30.941 --> 01:01:31.984
There it is.

01:01:41.702 --> 01:01:45.246
Does anybody think this guy is stupid
enough to make the exchange on the subway?

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:46.873
Maybe a station.

01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:49.417
But it's the way he wants
to keep Mr. King on the move.

01:01:49.418 --> 01:01:51.669
Maybe it has nothing to do
with the subway?

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:53.087
What difference does it make?

01:01:53.088 --> 01:01:55.424
- It makes one to us.
- Yeah.

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:18.237
What's the plan?

01:02:18.238 --> 01:02:22.992
The ransom will be in a black Jordan-brand
backpack, equipped with tracking device.

01:02:22.993 --> 01:02:25.286
You can all follow with your iPhones.

01:02:25.287 --> 01:02:28.247
We track the kidnapper
once Mr. King makes the drop,

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.082
<i>and we swoop in right away.</i>

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:32.460
<i>I'll be with Mr. King at all times.</i>

01:02:32.461 --> 01:02:34.921
<i>A team will cover the rest of the train.</i>

01:02:34.922 --> 01:02:39.884
We'll have pre-staged RMPs located
between where we board at Borough Hall

01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:41.844
<i>and the following stations:</i>

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:43.387
<i>Wall Street,</i>

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.473
<i>Union Square, Grand Central,</i>

01:02:45.474 --> 01:02:51.312
<i>59th, 86th, 125th, 149th, 161st,</i>

01:02:51.313 --> 01:02:55.399
<i>Yankee Stadium,
and until the last stop at Woodlawn.</i>

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.153
That way we can leapfrog, should there be
any police activity above ground.

01:02:59.154 --> 01:03:01.989
Mr. Christopher,
you'll ride with our other team.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:04.158
And when we locate and secure Kyle,

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:08.246
you'll both be brought to a location
for observation and debriefing.

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:11.749
Safety is always job number one.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.877
<i>The next priority is the money.</i>

01:03:14.878 --> 01:03:16.712
It's showtime.

01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:19.049
- Let's give the Kings a second, you guys.
- Uh-huh.

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.510
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:03:22.511 --> 01:03:23.887
No hero ball.

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:26.390
Come home to us, okay?

01:03:30.519 --> 01:03:32.103
- Out.
- Love you.

01:03:32.104 --> 01:03:33.355
More.

01:03:36.775 --> 01:03:38.151
Come on, let's go.

01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:40.236
All right.

01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:41.989
Don't worry. We got this.

01:04:01.633 --> 01:04:02.717
This one, right here.

01:04:02.718 --> 01:04:05.554
You're riding with me
and Detective Bell in this car.

01:04:06.972 --> 01:04:08.140
Just watch your head.

01:05:28.929 --> 01:05:30.931
Entering the transit system now.

01:06:00.294 --> 01:06:01.712
Take that seat over there.

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:10.678
<i>This is a Manhattan-bound 4 train.</i>

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:13.223
<i>The next stop is Bowling Green.</i>

01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:18.312
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

01:07:40.018 --> 01:07:43.689
Hit the siren! Let's go!
Come on, let's go, let's go! Damn it!

01:08:31.904 --> 01:08:33.572
Let's go, Yankees!

01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:35.782
Let's go, Yankees!

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.535
Boston sucks! Boston sucks!

01:08:39.536 --> 01:08:41.455
Let's go, Yankees!

01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:44.041
Let's go, Yankees!

01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:47.335
Boston sucks! Boston sucks!

01:08:47.336 --> 01:08:48.962
Let's go, Yankees!

01:08:49.837 --> 01:08:51.840
Let's go, Yankees!

01:08:52.549 --> 01:08:55.135
Boston sucks! Boston sucks!

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:09.358
They just departed 149 Street station,
still heading north.

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:15.531
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!

01:09:28.377 --> 01:09:31.421
I want y'all to give it up,
give it up for the beautiful,

01:09:32.089 --> 01:09:35.341
the perfect and immaculate Rosie Perez!

01:09:37.301 --> 01:09:40.304
And give it up to my brother from another,

01:09:40.305 --> 01:09:44.393
the very handsome and talented
Anthony Ramos!

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:49.021
Give it up for the legendary...

01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:53.694
The incomparable
Eddie Palmieri and Salsa Orchestra!

01:09:57.990 --> 01:10:00.450
One, two, one, two, three, four!

01:10:10.043 --> 01:10:11.795
Let's go, Yankees!

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:17.009
Let's go, Yankees!

01:10:19.511 --> 01:10:22.013
- Hello?
- <i>Move to the back of the subway car.</i>

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:24.348
- <i>Go between the cars.</i>
- Between the cars?

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:26.767
- <i>Take the backpack with you too.</i>
- Between the cars?

01:10:26.768 --> 01:10:28.853
<i>Yeah, nigga. The fuck? Is you deaf?</i>

01:10:28.854 --> 01:10:32.356
<i>Nigga fucking retarded, B.
Which part don't y'all understand?</i>

01:10:32.357 --> 01:10:34.568
- <i>Hurry the fuck up.</i>
- I'm moving, I'm moving.

01:10:37.196 --> 01:10:38.739
He's leaving the subway car.

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:50.875
Yo, okay, I'm here. So, do I drop it now?

01:10:50.876 --> 01:10:52.627
<i>No! When I tell you.</i>

01:10:52.628 --> 01:10:54.921
- What?
- <i>Drop the backpack when I say.</i>

01:10:54.922 --> 01:10:56.839
- Yeah, but I--
- <i>You're getting close, man.</i>

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.634
- Where's Kyle?
- <i>Yo, drop the fucking backpack first.</i>

01:10:59.635 --> 01:11:01.261
I wanna see Kyle first.

01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:11.522
Let's go, Yankees!

01:11:34.837 --> 01:11:36.504
I got a hit on the backpack.

01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:39.800
It's River Avenue and 157.
Heading to Yankee Stadium.

01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:55.481
Did y'all get the money?
I didn't see shit!

01:11:55.482 --> 01:11:58.442
- Don't worry! We got a GPS on the bag!
- I didn't drop it, it fell!

01:11:58.443 --> 01:12:00.570
We got a GPS on the bag!

01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:02.489
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Police, make way!

01:12:10.664 --> 01:12:13.208
Boston pulled the
motherfucking emergency brake!

01:12:14.418 --> 01:12:16.962
Boston pulled the
motherfucking emergency brake!

01:12:28.682 --> 01:12:30.099
Goddamn it, move it!

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.727
Fucking hate parades! Move it!

01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:37.357
Get the fuck outta the way!

01:12:43.947 --> 01:12:46.491
Give me that fucking flag!
Get the fuck outta here! Move it!

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:49.036
Get off my fucking car!

01:13:12.601 --> 01:13:14.394
Move it! Fuck!

01:13:39.211 --> 01:13:41.338
Oh, shit!

01:13:45.717 --> 01:13:47.009
It was an okey doke switcheroo.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.137
I got this guy. He's on a fucking moped.
No problem.

01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:17.457
Goddamn it! Fuck! Goddamn it!

01:14:21.837 --> 01:14:23.462
David, I promise
we're getting your money back.

01:14:23.463 --> 01:14:25.047
- How do you know?
- I just know.

01:14:25.048 --> 01:14:26.757
Well, yeah, well, make me know.

01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:30.344
- <i>Bridges, you there?</i>
- Yeah, I'm here with Mr. King.

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:33.140
I lost visuals on the moped.
I can't see him anywhere.

01:15:04.713 --> 01:15:06.173
Got this motherfucker.

01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:10.092
Get me additional units here, pronto!

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:12.596
I need units on foot available now, now!

01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:30.322
Now I got you, motherfucker!
I fuckin' got you!

01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:33.450
I fuckin' got you, you fuckin' pussy!

01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:36.745
Yeah, you better fuckin' run for it!

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:45.587
Fuck!

01:15:46.421 --> 01:15:48.006
Move out of the fuckin' way!

01:15:51.802 --> 01:15:53.929
Get out of the fuckin' way! Move it!

01:16:02.145 --> 01:16:04.231
Get out of the fuckin' way! Get him!

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.901
Cuff him! Are you fuckin' kidding me, huh?

01:16:09.069 --> 01:16:11.238
Give me this fuckin' bag!
Give me the fuckin' bag!

01:16:11.738 --> 01:16:13.156
Get on your fuckin' knees!

01:16:15.158 --> 01:16:17.034
What? Are you fuckin' kidding me?
A tampon?

01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:19.245
You think this is fuckin' funny, huh?

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:21.247
You having your period, motherfucker?

01:16:21.248 --> 01:16:22.624
Fuck off!

01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:29.255
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

01:16:29.256 --> 01:16:40.058
Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

01:16:47.024 --> 01:16:49.901
- <i>Bridges.</i>
- Higgins, talk to me, talk to me.

01:16:49.902 --> 01:16:51.903
- <i>Bridges, you there?</i>
- Where's the backpack?

01:16:51.904 --> 01:16:54.280
The ransom money is not in the bag.

01:16:54.281 --> 01:16:56.616
I repeat, the ransom money
is not in the bag.

01:16:56.617 --> 01:16:59.369
- The fuck?
- Shit.

01:17:17.638 --> 01:17:19.181
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:21.058 --> 01:17:22.350
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:24.102
Yeah. How is Kyle?

01:17:25.229 --> 01:17:26.395
He's a little banged-up.

01:17:26.396 --> 01:17:30.942
NYPD, well, they found him up there
by Yankee Stadium,

01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:33.361
<i>and sent him to the hospital
for observation,</i>

01:17:33.362 --> 01:17:35.404
<i>said they'd keep him there a couple days.</i>

01:17:35.405 --> 01:17:37.823
<i>Good. Good. Good. That's really good.</i>

01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:40.743
- <i>Hope we can see him soon.</i>
- <i>Hope so, son.</i>

01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:43.163
- And how are you?
- I'm all right.

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:45.457
- And the money?
- They said...

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.209
said they're working on it.

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.921
- Have you seen the news? Social media?
- No.

01:17:53.048 --> 01:17:56.133
You're everywhere.
Everybody is calling you a superhero.

01:17:56.134 --> 01:17:58.345
Black Panther of the Boogie Down Bronx.

01:18:00.639 --> 01:18:01.640
Damn.

01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.102
- You don't like it?
- No. No. Actually...

01:18:06.144 --> 01:18:07.437
Spelled my name right.

01:18:10.607 --> 01:18:13.234
All right. I'ma go upstairs and change.
I'll see y'all later.

01:18:13.235 --> 01:18:14.736
- All right.
- Love you.

01:18:20.534 --> 01:18:23.786
And what about the room
you were tied up in?

01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:26.623
Maybe a sound? Or did you smell anything?

01:18:27.624 --> 01:18:29.793
I smelled something funny.

01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:34.214
There was weed. Marijuana.

01:18:35.507 --> 01:18:37.133
I could hear music,

01:18:37.134 --> 01:18:39.385
a lot of music. Rap.

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:41.013
Like somebody's room or a club?

01:18:42.472 --> 01:18:45.100
It was in another room, another apartment.

01:18:46.643 --> 01:18:49.980
They had me tied up in the bathtub.

01:18:51.356 --> 01:18:53.107
I could hear it in and out.

01:18:53.108 --> 01:18:54.610
Anything specific?

01:18:56.570 --> 01:18:57.571
Not really.

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:06.455
There was this one song that kept playing
I'd never heard. It was like...

01:19:07.623 --> 01:19:08.957
Like...

01:19:19.801 --> 01:19:21.594
Kyle, Kyle.

01:19:21.595 --> 01:19:22.638
Anything else?

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:26.892
It's okay. Take your time, Kyle.

01:19:28.769 --> 01:19:30.102
Can I take a break?

01:19:30.103 --> 01:19:32.314
Let's just keep going, just a little more.

01:19:33.023 --> 01:19:36.025
- Just keep trying, Kyle. Just...
- I'm sorry.

01:19:36.026 --> 01:19:38.361
- I don't remember anything else.
- Okay.

01:19:38.362 --> 01:19:40.279
- Just a little more.
- Detective,

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.574
can he maybe have a little break?

01:19:43.325 --> 01:19:44.660
Kyle, I know it's hard,

01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:48.621
but every second we're not out there
looking for who did this,

01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:50.790
- they're getting away.
- Did you not hear me?

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:54.836
How come when Trey needed rest the other
day, y'all were ready to tuck him in bed?

01:19:54.837 --> 01:19:57.004
Now, listen, I heard you, Mr. Christopher.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:59.173
Now, why won't you stop being
a pain in my butt?

01:19:59.174 --> 01:20:01.467
Good you're in a hospital.
They got ointments for that.

01:20:01.468 --> 01:20:04.846
- Maybe you need the Preparation H.
- No, I'm fully prepared, brother.

01:20:04.847 --> 01:20:07.682
- You are?
- Maybe we need to all take a break.

01:20:07.683 --> 01:20:12.271
Can my son have a minute with his father,

01:20:12.938 --> 01:20:15.148
just him and me alone please?

01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:18.986
- Come on, guys. Let's give him a minute.
- Thank you.

01:20:20.279 --> 01:20:22.071
Let's go. Come on. Partner.

01:20:22.072 --> 01:20:23.824
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

01:20:25.826 --> 01:20:27.077
Bridges.

01:20:43.385 --> 01:20:46.471
It's all right, man. It's all right.

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:09.369
Yeah. Come on in, Gabe.

01:21:10.495 --> 01:21:11.580
David.

01:21:12.998 --> 01:21:14.124
Gabe.

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:20.255
- So, you talk to Michelle?
- Talked to Michelle, Barry, Lindsey.

01:21:21.173 --> 01:21:24.218
All the principal creditors
and their partners.

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.219
And?

01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:28.013
They greatly admire what you did,

01:21:29.681 --> 01:21:33.060
but they don't want
to be held responsible.

01:21:35.312 --> 01:21:38.649
- What you saying?
- That viral video that went global.

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:42.985
You dropping the $17.5 million
from the 4 train.

01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:44.112
Okay. What about it?

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.782
The deal was contingent on you
using that financing

01:21:47.783 --> 01:21:51.285
to buy back control
of Stackin' Hits Records.

01:21:51.286 --> 01:21:53.454
- Right.
- The deal is off.

01:21:53.455 --> 01:21:56.999
Deal is off? I mean, I can come up
with the money to pay the interest.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.751
I can scrounge that up, Gabe.
You know that.

01:21:58.752 --> 01:22:00.670
- I'm a hustler, man. I can hustle.
- Normally.

01:22:00.671 --> 01:22:02.839
- Yeah. Normally you could. Yeah.
- Normally?

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.342
Yeah, but this is some abnormal shit.
You know, this is a breach of contract.

01:22:06.343 --> 01:22:08.428
- Breach of contract?
- Yeah. Or fraud.

01:22:13.767 --> 01:22:17.436
Fraud? Like F-R-A-U-D? Like prison?

01:22:17.437 --> 01:22:18.897
- Prison.
- Jail.

01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:23.067
Damn. Gabe. Talk to me.

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:25.820
Well, the reason is because your investors

01:22:25.821 --> 01:22:28.865
negotiated a provision
for use of proceeds,

01:22:28.866 --> 01:22:34.745
that their investment has to be used
for certain defined purposes.

01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:38.082
And that's buying back
Stackin' Hits Records.

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:39.917
And they want their money back.

01:22:39.918 --> 01:22:41.711
- When?
- Two weeks.

01:22:41.712 --> 01:22:43.171
- Two weeks?
- I didn't stutter.

01:22:43.172 --> 01:22:44.630
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:46.507
- Two weeks.
- And after that,

01:22:46.508 --> 01:22:49.844
they'll start collection process.

01:22:49.845 --> 01:22:51.054
Your penthouse,

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:53.807
your Sag Harbor home,

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:57.059
your Basquiats. All your artwork.

01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.937
You did a good thing and...

01:23:01.398 --> 01:23:02.315
It's not fair.

01:23:02.316 --> 01:23:05.359
I did a good thing,
but I don't feel good, Gabe.

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:07.945
How can I feel good? Make me feel good.

01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:09.864
- I know.
- Gabriel. Come on, man.

01:23:09.865 --> 01:23:12.158
- I know.
- I can't go out like this. You know that.

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:13.743
A man can't go out
the same way he came in.

01:23:13.744 --> 01:23:15.746
A man's gotta add up to something.
And that's you.

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:21.793
Two weeks.

01:24:14.137 --> 01:24:16.305
- Yes?
- I'm so sorry to bother you.

01:24:16.306 --> 01:24:18.516
Alex and Patrick
would like to chat with you.

01:24:18.517 --> 01:24:19.601
Send 'em in.

01:24:22.187 --> 01:24:23.813
Mr. King will see you now.

01:24:23.814 --> 01:24:25.648
Just the two I wanted to see.

01:24:25.649 --> 01:24:27.609
I would wanna be you if I wasn't me.

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.279
Listen, with everything that
has happened in the last few days,

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.990
I've gained a new perspective
on the Stray Dog Enterprise deal.

01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:38.120
Now, I know I was the lone holdout,
but I've changed my mind.

01:24:41.331 --> 01:24:43.000
Let's do it. Let's do the damn thing.

01:24:44.918 --> 01:24:49.005
I see. Well, I would have let you
know sooner if I'd known,

01:24:49.006 --> 01:24:52.092
but the cat's in the bag
and the bag's in the East River.

01:24:53.093 --> 01:24:54.927
The who's in the what? What do you mean?

01:24:54.928 --> 01:24:56.304
It's dead in the water.

01:24:56.305 --> 01:24:57.680
What do you mean dead?

01:24:57.681 --> 01:25:00.308
After your unfortunate situation,

01:25:00.309 --> 01:25:02.101
I had a change of heart too.

01:25:02.102 --> 01:25:05.731
I told Stray Dog Enterprises we're out.

01:25:09.651 --> 01:25:12.445
You killed the deal
because of what happened. Why?

01:25:12.446 --> 01:25:16.449
Your hero status
has us back on the front page.

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:19.368
Every artist in our catalog
has seen a jump in sales.

01:25:19.369 --> 01:25:20.828
So, it's like you always said:

01:25:20.829 --> 01:25:24.081
"Attention is the only
true currency nowadays."

01:25:24.082 --> 01:25:25.876
Don't you know? You're...

01:25:28.212 --> 01:25:31.757
You're "Da Black Panther
of Da Boogie Down Bronx."

01:25:39.473 --> 01:25:41.599
All right. Easy one.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.393
I'll call Stray Dog myself,
talk with them personally.

01:25:44.394 --> 01:25:47.271
I suggest not until we see this play out.

01:25:47.272 --> 01:25:49.941
Who knows how much money
we could be leaving on the table?

01:25:49.942 --> 01:25:52.068
How much money we leave...
Look, I need this money now.

01:25:52.069 --> 01:25:55.280
Like, with an alacrity, a quickness.
I need it yesterday. I need the money now.

01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:57.323
I got it.

01:25:57.324 --> 01:25:59.867
Well, that's ironic.

01:25:59.868 --> 01:26:03.162
You certainly didn't need the money
when you were trying to sabotage the deal

01:26:03.163 --> 01:26:04.581
- two days ago.
- Alex!

01:26:12.714 --> 01:26:14.049
I see.

01:26:14.633 --> 01:26:17.218
Patrick, you told him, didn't you?

01:26:17.219 --> 01:26:18.679
You didn't leave me any choice.

01:26:19.471 --> 01:26:22.515
When the news about Trey came out,
Alex called me multiple times

01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:24.725
- asking what I thought.
- About what?

01:26:24.726 --> 01:26:26.352
The attention we were getting.

01:26:26.353 --> 01:26:29.647
So, the two of youse discussed
the attention we were getting

01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.524
from my son being kidnapped.

01:26:31.525 --> 01:26:33.651
Stop. It wasn't like that.

01:26:33.652 --> 01:26:36.279
What was it like? It was a good thing
he wasn't killed. Shot in the head.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.780
- Coulda got rich.
- David!

01:26:37.781 --> 01:26:40.116
- Nice house in the Hamptons.
- David, stop!

01:26:40.117 --> 01:26:42.660
- Stop what?
- Stop being so self-righteous.

01:26:42.661 --> 01:26:45.955
You stood in your lobby
trying to convince me

01:26:45.956 --> 01:26:48.499
that the bad PR would pass if Kyle died.

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:50.626
That was different. I was talk...

01:26:50.627 --> 01:26:53.754
I was talking out loud, you know that.
I was just trying to figure things out.

01:26:53.755 --> 01:26:55.923
Well, so was I. That's why I called you.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:57.884
I didn't know if your situation changed.

01:26:57.885 --> 01:27:00.094
- So, you threw me under the bus?
- No.

01:27:00.095 --> 01:27:01.889
I tried to protect myself.

01:27:02.514 --> 01:27:04.975
Because in this business
I know no one else will.

01:27:22.993 --> 01:27:24.036
Alex!

01:27:45.390 --> 01:27:47.017
Oh, shucks.

01:28:58.172 --> 01:29:00.173
Stand down, stand down. I got this.

01:29:00.174 --> 01:29:03.217
All righty. Make it quick. Make it quick.

01:29:03.218 --> 01:29:04.677
I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:06.888
- I just need to see what he knows.
- What the fuck?

01:29:06.889 --> 01:29:10.433
- King, what's up?
- Just something I wanna play for him.

01:29:10.434 --> 01:29:13.978
Mr. King, we're trying
to get new information here.

01:29:13.979 --> 01:29:15.606
No, I understand. I understand.

01:29:16.857 --> 01:29:19.735
Is this the song... Was this the song
you heard when they had you?

01:29:29.661 --> 01:29:32.121
- That's crazy. How'd you know?
- That's him, right?

01:29:32.122 --> 01:29:34.790
- What?
- His name is Yung Felon. He's a rapper.

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:37.460
He was on the playlist
that my son Trey gave me.

01:29:37.461 --> 01:29:39.962
It's the same voice, the same voice
from the phone. It's him.

01:29:39.963 --> 01:29:43.049
I don't know, Mr. King. All these new
rappers these days sound alike to me.

01:29:43.050 --> 01:29:45.801
- I think I've seen this clown before.
- What?

01:29:45.802 --> 01:29:48.387
- He came up to me once.
- Do you remember where or when?

01:29:48.388 --> 01:29:50.765
I remembered his face.
Something was off about him.

01:29:50.766 --> 01:29:52.934
He wanted to meet you,
said he was from around our way.

01:29:52.935 --> 01:29:54.519
Do you remember his government name?

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.521
People come up to me all the time
wanting to meet King.

01:29:56.522 --> 01:30:00.525
- I don't get into all that with them.
- It could be the kidnapper, Detective.

01:30:00.526 --> 01:30:03.444
Yeah, but identifying a rapper
is not what I would call a slam dunk.

01:30:03.445 --> 01:30:06.239
I'm telling you, it's him.
I got the best ears in the business.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.158
I know it when I hear it.
I can hear the desperation. It's him.

01:30:09.159 --> 01:30:11.577
I know him when I hear him,
and this is him.

01:30:11.578 --> 01:30:15.122
- It's him. It's the voice.
- Mr. King. It could be.

01:30:15.123 --> 01:30:16.416
Nobody's refuting that.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.918
Hang on a second.
We got the recordings, right?

01:30:18.919 --> 01:30:21.128
- Yeah.
- All right, so Forensics can do

01:30:21.129 --> 01:30:22.463
a digital comparison of them both.

01:30:22.464 --> 01:30:24.048
Maybe even check on AI, right?

01:30:24.049 --> 01:30:27.051
Yeah, we could send something over.
It may take time, but we'll send it over.

01:30:27.052 --> 01:30:29.011
I don't need no AI
to tell me what I already know.

01:30:29.012 --> 01:30:31.597
- I know music, and I know that's him.
- Mr. King, you know what I know?

01:30:31.598 --> 01:30:33.808
I know police work, okay?
And I know how these cases go.

01:30:33.809 --> 01:30:36.519
Can you just let us get back
to interviewing Kyle here, please?

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.981
And then we will get to your clue,
I promise you, in the order it's deserved.

01:30:39.982 --> 01:30:41.441
Please. I'm begging you.

01:30:43.318 --> 01:30:46.153
- It's just protocol.
- Please.

01:30:46.154 --> 01:30:49.365
- Thank you for stopping by.
- Thanks, Mr. King.

01:30:49.366 --> 01:30:51.577
- Thank you, Mr. King.
- Thank you.

01:30:58.959 --> 01:31:00.043
King.

01:31:04.298 --> 01:31:07.008
- You really think that's him?
- I don't think. I know. I can hear it.

01:31:07.009 --> 01:31:09.427
- I know it's him.
- Fuck these dicks.

01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:10.804
Let's go get your money.

01:31:11.847 --> 01:31:15.100
- Yeah, but where we gonna find this kid?
- I'm betting these streets know.

01:31:17.853 --> 01:31:19.438
Yo, you saw what I sent you?

01:31:21.148 --> 01:31:22.191
You sure that's him?

01:31:23.483 --> 01:31:24.484
Where?

01:31:25.819 --> 01:31:27.862
Bet. I owe you one.

01:31:27.863 --> 01:31:30.448
- Where's he at? Where?
- I got him. 804 Forest Avenue.

01:31:30.449 --> 01:31:32.451
- Right in the old hood.
- That's him.

01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:36.765
What is that?

01:32:38.392 --> 01:32:39.393
Insurance.

01:32:40.269 --> 01:32:41.687
That's Jake from State Farm.

01:32:45.858 --> 01:32:48.943
Where are you?
I'm out here. I haven't seen him.

01:32:48.944 --> 01:32:51.362
- Here's a yard. Watch my car.
- All right, chief.

01:32:51.363 --> 01:32:54.074
Yeah, yeah. Good lookin' out.
I got you. I got you.

01:33:24.438 --> 01:33:27.941
- Hello? Can I help you?
- How you doing, <i>mami</i>?

01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:32.403
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:33:32.404 --> 01:33:35.448
I know you. I know you.

01:33:35.449 --> 01:33:38.701
I've just seen you on TV.
You from the kidnapping, right?

01:33:38.702 --> 01:33:41.287
- Right.
- I hope 12 got your money back.

01:33:41.288 --> 01:33:42.873
I'll wait in the car.

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.791
- Blessings. Sorry.
- Thank you.

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:49.379
- Can I come in?
- Yeah. I'm Rosa. Come in. Please.

01:33:55.969 --> 01:33:57.471
I just put the baby down.

01:33:58.972 --> 01:34:00.515
Archie named him after you.

01:34:00.516 --> 01:34:01.724
Archie?

01:34:01.725 --> 01:34:03.267
His tag is Yung Felon.

01:34:03.268 --> 01:34:06.354
But I ain't really trying to call him
no Yung Felon.

01:34:06.355 --> 01:34:08.815
I tell him if he keep up this stuff,

01:34:09.566 --> 01:34:11.484
he gonna be an old-ass felon.

01:34:11.485 --> 01:34:13.611
- Where's he at?
- He's at the studio.

01:34:13.612 --> 01:34:16.155
He's basically been living there
for, like, two weeks.

01:34:16.156 --> 01:34:18.699
Oh, my God. He gonna lose his mind.

01:34:18.700 --> 01:34:20.910
- He gonna bug the fuck out.
- Why you say that?

01:34:20.911 --> 01:34:22.745
You're like a god to him.

01:34:22.746 --> 01:34:25.206
He follows you on social media.

01:34:25.207 --> 01:34:28.501
He listens to your podcast.
He watches all your interviews.

01:34:28.502 --> 01:34:31.254
- He knows everything about you.
- Really?

01:34:31.255 --> 01:34:34.465
He been saying for years
King David will come and discover him,

01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:37.426
and change everything for us.
Even I believed it.

01:34:37.427 --> 01:34:40.806
He's been at this music thing
ever since he came home from Upstate.

01:34:41.306 --> 01:34:43.140
He said that music was the only thing

01:34:43.141 --> 01:34:45.602
that was giving him hope
while he was locked up, besides me.

01:34:47.062 --> 01:34:49.398
I think I should call him. This is crazy.

01:34:50.107 --> 01:34:52.234
No, I wanna surprise him.

01:34:53.402 --> 01:34:55.903
I'll go by the studio. Where's it at?

01:34:55.904 --> 01:34:59.490
It's right around the corner.
It's 333 Trinity Avenue.

01:34:59.491 --> 01:35:01.742
If you go to the basement,
you'll find a red door.

01:35:01.743 --> 01:35:04.036
- Okay.
- He's there now.

01:35:04.037 --> 01:35:08.208
Well. That's a nice piece there.

01:35:08.917 --> 01:35:10.043
He got it for me yesterday.

01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:12.461
- Yesterday?
- Yeah.

01:35:12.462 --> 01:35:15.798
I don't know where he got it from,
and I didn't ask where he got it from,

01:35:15.799 --> 01:35:19.594
- but I know it's not no Cartier.
- Mind if I take a picture?

01:35:19.595 --> 01:35:21.888
I'm thinking about getting my wife
something like that...

01:35:21.889 --> 01:35:24.223
- God. Yeah. Please take a pic.
- ...for our wedding anniversary.

01:35:24.224 --> 01:35:25.559
Get my good side.

01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:28.644
Thank you.

01:35:28.645 --> 01:35:31.397
<i>I seen your wife online. She's beautiful.</i>

01:35:31.398 --> 01:35:32.940
<i>You a lucky man.</i>

01:35:32.941 --> 01:35:34.151
Thank you.

01:35:35.027 --> 01:35:36.611
Yes, I am.

01:35:36.612 --> 01:35:40.740
I'm so happy you're here,
'cause Archie been acting really weird.

01:35:40.741 --> 01:35:42.366
He been off lately.

01:35:42.367 --> 01:35:44.160
I feel like he been losing hope.

01:35:44.161 --> 01:35:47.080
And hope is the only thing he had
for a long time.

01:35:47.789 --> 01:35:51.542
Me being a new mom
and you showing up at our front door,

01:35:51.543 --> 01:35:53.253
I feel like it's a sign.

01:35:54.796 --> 01:35:57.716
You've changed so many people's lives
in a positive way.

01:35:59.718 --> 01:36:01.011
God is great.

01:36:13.357 --> 01:36:14.441
Gimme that thing.

01:36:15.275 --> 01:36:17.694
- Thing? What thing?
- That four-pounder, kid.

01:36:26.954 --> 01:36:28.330
What is that?

01:36:29.581 --> 01:36:31.249
That's mayhem.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:32.709
Shit.

01:36:57.317 --> 01:36:58.735
How you wanna do this?

01:37:02.906 --> 01:37:05.658
- King, you wanna follow my lead?
- You're not going in.

01:37:05.659 --> 01:37:08.369
- What do you mean?
- I mean I got into this by myself.

01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:10.413
I'm gonna get out of it by myself.
You're not going in.

01:37:10.414 --> 01:37:12.748
Hold up. Hold up. I'm with you.

01:37:12.749 --> 01:37:14.417
We here right now.

01:37:14.418 --> 01:37:17.045
You saw what he did to Kyle. I'm...

01:37:18.672 --> 01:37:20.716
I ain't gonna lie. I wanna hurt this boy.

01:37:24.595 --> 01:37:27.681
- Meet me in the front.
- I'll be there.

01:40:19.811 --> 01:40:21.230
Yo, what the fuck?

01:40:24.942 --> 01:40:27.777
So, what, you got police waiting
outside for a nigga or something?

01:40:27.778 --> 01:40:29.195
How the fuck you found me?

01:40:29.196 --> 01:40:32.241
You ain't hard to find.
I heard one of your hot joints.

01:40:32.783 --> 01:40:35.701
Okay, and? So, what about it?

01:40:35.702 --> 01:40:38.163
- You got a lot of potential.
- Potential?

01:40:38.872 --> 01:40:40.498
Nigga, fuck outta here. You deaf, nigga?

01:40:40.499 --> 01:40:43.668
My shit lit. My shit buzzing out there.

01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:46.337
Beyond potential. Proof is in the pudding.

01:40:46.338 --> 01:40:49.924
My niggas on the block,
all the niggas in the trenches and shit.

01:40:49.925 --> 01:40:52.426
They show a nigga that real love,
that hood love.

01:40:52.427 --> 01:40:54.929
That's my core audience.
That's all I need.

01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:57.098
You want a bigger audience? Do the math.

01:40:57.099 --> 01:40:58.975
You talking about 50 niggas, man.

01:40:58.976 --> 01:41:00.185
They love you.

01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:02.144
They payin' you?

01:41:02.145 --> 01:41:04.606
Are they showing you any money?
That's a yes or no answer.

01:41:05.232 --> 01:41:07.692
They don't gotta show me shit, nigga.
I'm up right now.

01:41:07.693 --> 01:41:09.485
How much you up? Seventeen-five?

01:41:09.486 --> 01:41:11.696
- To be precise.
- You sure?

01:41:11.697 --> 01:41:13.531
- Yeah.
- You're seventeen-five to the good?

01:41:13.532 --> 01:41:15.784
- Swiss francs.
- You think you gonna leave here with it?

01:41:16.535 --> 01:41:18.494
- You'll see.
- Who taught you to do wrong, B?

01:41:18.495 --> 01:41:21.415
Who told you you weren't any good?
Who broke your heart?

01:41:22.457 --> 01:41:25.501
- Where's your father?
- Fuck that nigga.

01:41:25.502 --> 01:41:27.545
So, he did what you did, huh?

01:41:27.546 --> 01:41:29.714
So, you gonna be better than him?
Bigger than him?

01:41:29.715 --> 01:41:31.383
You gonna do a longer bid than him?

01:41:32.009 --> 01:41:34.051
What you wanna do?
Decades? Yards? What you want?

01:41:34.052 --> 01:41:37.138
- What the fuck you want me to say, nigga?
- Doesn't matter what I want.

01:41:37.139 --> 01:41:39.515
It's a matter of what you want.
You want some advice?

01:41:39.516 --> 01:41:42.268
Advice? Aight.

01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:44.770
We here, why the fuck not? I'm all ears.

01:41:44.771 --> 01:41:47.273
On the chorus, ad-lib a little bit.

01:41:47.274 --> 01:41:49.776
Layer the vocals differently.
Something like...

01:41:50.652 --> 01:41:52.653
<i>Nigga, where's my money?</i>

01:41:52.654 --> 01:41:54.655
<i>I got the four-pounder
Sitting right here</i>

01:41:54.656 --> 01:41:56.073
<i>Don't try nothing funny</i>

01:41:56.074 --> 01:41:58.869
Something like that, you know?
Nasir, '93, '94.

01:42:00.329 --> 01:42:02.079
Man, all that old shit you talking about...

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:03.831
Nah, nigga. Sound more like...

01:42:03.832 --> 01:42:07.835
<i>I got the blicky on me, OG
So don't try nothing tricky on me OG</i>

01:42:07.836 --> 01:42:10.379
<i>I got mine too, young G
Nine millimeters</i>

01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:12.965
<i>A lot of reasons why you shouldn't
Fuck with me either, young G</i>

01:42:12.966 --> 01:42:14.091
<i>I'm the one that can pay you</i>

01:42:14.092 --> 01:42:15.760
<i>I don't need to be the one
That's gon' slay you</i>

01:42:15.761 --> 01:42:17.803
Fuck, is this a battle right now?

01:42:17.804 --> 01:42:19.597
<i>I'm the brutalizer</i>

01:42:19.598 --> 01:42:21.641
<i>I'm the Buddha-sizer
I'm the accelerator</i>

01:42:21.642 --> 01:42:23.684
<i>I ain't the type of nigga
That be pissing in your elevator</i>

01:42:23.685 --> 01:42:26.103
<i>But sometimes the rap game
Remind me of the crap game</i>

01:42:26.104 --> 01:42:28.564
<i>I used to sport Ballys
And Cazals with black frames</i>

01:42:28.565 --> 01:42:30.692
<i>But now I'm into new chicks
TECs and Beck's</i>

01:42:31.443 --> 01:42:33.653
Come on, represent. Give me something.

01:42:33.654 --> 01:42:38.157
<i>I gotta feed the streets
My lady and a newborn kid</i>

01:42:38.158 --> 01:42:40.993
<i>And I ain't tryna go back
And do another bid, you dig?</i>

01:42:40.994 --> 01:42:43.247
Then handle your business
and do what's right.

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:46.207
Keep your head up.

01:42:46.208 --> 01:42:48.460
Now this nigga a motherfucking rapper.

01:42:50.170 --> 01:42:51.171
I ain't no rapper.

01:42:53.215 --> 01:42:55.716
- I'm a chance giver.
- Chance?

01:42:55.717 --> 01:42:57.969
Yo, you mad late, son.

01:42:57.970 --> 01:43:01.347
I been gave you a chance
to give me a chance. You baited.

01:43:01.348 --> 01:43:04.433
Nah, I'm good, B. It's quiet. Curtains.

01:43:04.434 --> 01:43:08.020
I know what it is to risk everything
you have for something that you want.

01:43:08.021 --> 01:43:09.480
I know what that means.

01:43:09.481 --> 01:43:12.024
To have nothing and want everything.

01:43:12.025 --> 01:43:14.318
- I met your girl.
- Fuck you mean?

01:43:14.319 --> 01:43:15.820
I been in your house,

01:43:15.821 --> 01:43:18.489
and I appreciate you
for naming your son after me.

01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:22.076
Damn!
Stupid bitch talk too fucking much, B.

01:43:22.077 --> 01:43:25.956
- Why she gotta be a bitch?
- Fuck.

01:43:27.457 --> 01:43:29.542
- Why she gotta be a bitch?
- Damn, B.

01:43:29.543 --> 01:43:32.336
Now, I've made some mistakes.
Big ones. We all have.

01:43:32.337 --> 01:43:36.216
- I just wanna try and help you.
- Help me? Man, fuck outta here, man.

01:43:37.009 --> 01:43:39.760
Aight, so what? You know where I lay.
I know where you stay.

01:43:39.761 --> 01:43:41.804
Nigga, what? What you wanna do? What?

01:43:41.805 --> 01:43:44.098
- What?
- You hollow on the inside.

01:43:44.099 --> 01:43:45.850
You lonely on the inside.

01:43:45.851 --> 01:43:47.560
You quiet on the inside.

01:43:47.561 --> 01:43:50.229
You hurt on the inside.
That's what I wanna feel.

01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:52.857
That's what I wanna see.
That's what I wanna know.

01:43:52.858 --> 01:43:54.525
I wanna know what's inside you.

01:43:54.526 --> 01:43:56.569
Fuck all this fake outdoor shit.

01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:58.237
Who are you?

01:43:58.238 --> 01:43:59.990
Yo, you know what's crazy?

01:44:00.782 --> 01:44:03.242
You don't know how long
I dreamt about this shit.

01:44:03.243 --> 01:44:06.495
Me and you in the lab together,
just like this.

01:44:06.496 --> 01:44:08.456
When I got out the pen,

01:44:08.457 --> 01:44:11.584
I stood out of Stackin' Hits offices,

01:44:11.585 --> 01:44:14.462
recording studios, business meetings.

01:44:14.463 --> 01:44:17.423
I even followed your little nigga Trey
on social media.

01:44:17.424 --> 01:44:19.509
See where y'all niggas
gonna be at dining and shit.

01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:22.011
Hoping we could meet up.
Hoping I'd bump into you.

01:44:22.012 --> 01:44:23.638
Hoping you'd give me time of the day.

01:44:23.639 --> 01:44:24.931
Hoping you'd hear me.

01:44:24.932 --> 01:44:26.934
I used to be on the Brooklyn Bridge

01:44:27.643 --> 01:44:29.644
just looking up at you, at your terrace.

01:44:29.645 --> 01:44:31.103
You know, the Dumbo Olympia, nigga.

01:44:31.104 --> 01:44:33.147
I told you
I know where you lay too, nigga.

01:44:33.148 --> 01:44:34.565
Shit ain't about nothing.

01:44:34.566 --> 01:44:38.528
Just to find out you got
the worst ears in the fucking business.

01:44:38.529 --> 01:44:41.822
But you hear me now though, right, nigga?
You hear me now though, right?

01:44:41.823 --> 01:44:44.575
Now what? Now what do we do? Now what?

01:44:44.576 --> 01:44:46.954
Unfold your arms, nigga.
Now what do we do?

01:44:47.663 --> 01:44:49.455
What, you bad? You big?

01:44:49.456 --> 01:44:51.457
Your elbows is showing, so is your nine.

01:44:51.458 --> 01:44:53.334
You got your blicky and I got mine.

01:44:53.335 --> 01:44:54.502
What you wanna do, nigga?

01:44:54.503 --> 01:44:56.003
It's between me and you, nigga.

01:44:56.004 --> 01:44:57.505
Show me what you got, nigga.

01:44:57.506 --> 01:45:00.926
You know what, B?
Manifestation is a motherfucker.

01:45:02.302 --> 01:45:05.055
You should never underestimate
the power of prayer, nigga.

01:45:41.592 --> 01:45:43.010
King! King!

01:45:49.766 --> 01:45:53.603
My eye. My eye.
Glass in my eye, glass in my eye!

01:45:53.604 --> 01:45:54.688
Get the money!

01:45:55.355 --> 01:45:58.108
Get his bitch ass!
Get that bitch motherfucker!

01:45:59.568 --> 01:46:00.694
I got glass in my eye.

01:49:31.697 --> 01:49:33.656
Let me go! Let me go, man!

01:49:33.657 --> 01:49:36.742
What you doing? Let me go!

01:49:36.743 --> 01:49:39.370
- I ought to let your ass go.
- Come on, man. I don't wanna be here.

01:49:39.371 --> 01:49:40.621
- Let me go!
- What?

01:49:40.622 --> 01:49:42.415
- Let me die!
- Where's my money?

01:49:42.416 --> 01:49:45.126
- Let me die, man!
- You lucky you got a son named after me.

01:49:45.127 --> 01:49:46.503
Get your ass up here.

01:50:01.059 --> 01:50:02.227
Come on!

01:50:23.081 --> 01:50:25.501
- Yo, Higgins!
- Detective Bell.

01:50:27.503 --> 01:50:29.421
- What's up?
- Lord have mercy.

01:50:30.005 --> 01:50:31.756
When will my people understand

01:50:31.757 --> 01:50:34.217
that under the bed is the first spot
we're gonna look?

01:50:34.218 --> 01:50:36.636
Don't ask me about your people, hmm?

01:50:36.637 --> 01:50:38.679
Watch that, son.

01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.057
"Son."

01:50:58.325 --> 01:50:59.701
Come on in.

01:51:02.579 --> 01:51:04.747
Hey, come on in, fam. Don't be shy.

01:51:04.748 --> 01:51:08.417
- How are you?
- As good as can be expected, I guess.

01:51:08.418 --> 01:51:11.212
How many times I ask you
to bulletproof that Rolls?

01:51:11.213 --> 01:51:15.342
Oh, yeah, well, one-eyed man
is king in the land of the blind.

01:51:16.468 --> 01:51:17.718
Well, that's true.

01:51:17.719 --> 01:51:19.971
But it's the third eye that sees, beloved.

01:51:19.972 --> 01:51:21.682
Correct, Cyclops.

01:51:24.268 --> 01:51:25.477
I hope you see...

01:51:26.478 --> 01:51:28.354
that I want you to come back
and work with me.

01:51:28.355 --> 01:51:30.148
I appreciate that, King.

01:51:31.233 --> 01:51:35.028
But I think it's time
to find something new for...

01:51:36.530 --> 01:51:37.780
for me and Kyle.

01:51:37.781 --> 01:51:39.282
So, I'll respectfully decline.

01:51:39.283 --> 01:51:40.576
I understand.

01:51:41.201 --> 01:51:42.869
- Yeah.
- I overstand.

01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:45.371
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah. Little bumps and bruises,

01:51:45.372 --> 01:51:47.957
but I'm good.

01:51:47.958 --> 01:51:51.252
Never got a chance to... thank you.

01:51:51.253 --> 01:51:53.546
It's nothing.
You know, I'd do it all again.

01:51:53.547 --> 01:51:55.299
You know, I always got your back.

01:51:55.924 --> 01:51:57.259
And I got yours.

01:51:58.177 --> 01:51:59.635
Dad, did you see this?

01:51:59.636 --> 01:52:03.015
Four of the top ten songs
on Billboard Hot 100

01:52:03.682 --> 01:52:05.559
are from Stackin' Hits artists.

01:52:06.768 --> 01:52:08.478
It's almost like it's 2004.

01:52:10.731 --> 01:52:12.398
- 2004.
- Yeah.

01:52:12.399 --> 01:52:14.901
- No.
- Four out of ten, that's not bad, though.

01:52:14.902 --> 01:52:16.028
That's not bad.

01:52:17.821 --> 01:52:20.656
Paul, you keep getting better, okay?
Let's give 'em a minute.

01:52:20.657 --> 01:52:21.908
All right.

01:52:21.909 --> 01:52:24.411
Yeah, bruh. Kyle, give us a minute.

01:52:25.412 --> 01:52:27.748
- Yeah, give us two minutes.
- Yeah.

01:52:42.638 --> 01:52:44.805
- Always.
- Forever.

01:52:44.806 --> 01:52:46.099
And a day.

01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:52.940
- All right, brother.
- Yeah.

01:52:54.733 --> 01:52:56.985
- Stay Black.
- Yes, beloved.

01:53:05.869 --> 01:53:28.266
Free Yung Felon! Free Yung Felon!

01:53:28.267 --> 01:53:30.977
Let's go. Come on, come on.
Get out of the way.

01:53:30.978 --> 01:53:32.728
I'm innocent! I'm innocent.

01:53:32.729 --> 01:53:34.438
- Get away. Stop it.
- I didn't do shit.

01:53:34.439 --> 01:53:37.400
- Get outta here.
- Free me! Yeah.

01:53:37.401 --> 01:53:38.902
I ain't do shit.

01:53:40.028 --> 01:53:41.904
- I'm innocent.
- Come on, let's go.

01:53:41.905 --> 01:53:43.614
- Keep it going, movie star.
- Peace and love, people!

01:53:43.615 --> 01:53:48.160
Free Yung Felon! Free Yung Felon!
Free Yung Felon!

01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:50.580
- Come on, let's go. Move it. Move it.
- Peace and love.

01:53:50.581 --> 01:53:52.749
- Let's go. Move it.
- Peace and love, people!

01:53:53.834 --> 01:53:56.170
Only God can judge me now, baby.

01:53:56.795 --> 01:53:59.213
Free Yung Felon!

01:53:59.214 --> 01:54:01.757
- Free Yung Felon! Free Yung Felon!
- Turn around. Say bye to your fans.

01:54:01.758 --> 01:54:03.801
Free Yung Felon!

01:54:03.802 --> 01:54:05.596
- Let's go.
- I ain't do shit!

01:54:06.889 --> 01:54:08.807
We very much appreciate you stopping by.

01:54:09.516 --> 01:54:12.101
Yung Felon's attorney and the DA's office

01:54:12.102 --> 01:54:14.980
has just finished hashing out the details
of his plea agreement.

01:54:15.814 --> 01:54:17.024
There'll be no trial.

01:54:17.733 --> 01:54:20.151
So, no appeal? No media circus?

01:54:20.152 --> 01:54:23.571
The only thing he asked for
was to talk to you one more time.

01:54:23.572 --> 01:54:26.158
- Talk to me?
- That's what the man requested.

01:54:28.994 --> 01:54:31.205
- How many years is he getting?
- Twenty-five years.

01:54:33.916 --> 01:54:34.917
Not enough.

01:56:02.045 --> 01:56:03.046
King David.

01:56:04.006 --> 01:56:06.049
It's been a little minute.
Good to see you.

01:56:06.758 --> 01:56:09.385
- Again.
- What can I do for you?

01:56:09.386 --> 01:56:11.555
Well, actually, quite the contrary.

01:56:12.139 --> 01:56:13.764
I'm here to do something for you.

01:56:13.765 --> 01:56:16.100
- For me?
- Hell yeah.

01:56:16.101 --> 01:56:18.394
I'm going to let you have
the privilege and honor

01:56:18.395 --> 01:56:20.731
of signing me to Stackin' Hits Records.

01:56:21.315 --> 01:56:23.108
A lucrative business deal.

01:56:23.901 --> 01:56:27.403
My lawyer will be contacting you
with a quickness.

01:56:27.404 --> 01:56:28.488
Excuse me?

01:56:32.075 --> 01:56:35.119
I'm the biggest newest streaming artist
in the world right now.

01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:38.039
- Really?
- Over a billion streams since my arrest.

01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:40.208
Not even just in the US, but globally.

01:56:40.209 --> 01:56:41.709
Is that right?

01:56:41.710 --> 01:56:43.753
How the fuck you ain't know that?

01:56:43.754 --> 01:56:45.838
Yo, that's bugged-the-fuck-out, like,

01:56:45.839 --> 01:56:48.675
you gotta keep up with the times, man.
Where you been at?

01:56:49.384 --> 01:56:51.178
Do your homework, King David.

01:56:52.221 --> 01:56:55.473
Yo, I ain't gonna lie,
this shit is surreal right now.

01:56:55.474 --> 01:56:58.017
I swear, this shit is bugged-out, like.

01:56:58.018 --> 01:57:00.521
You know how long
I've been waiting on this moment?

01:57:01.188 --> 01:57:02.648
My whole life, nigga.

01:57:03.482 --> 01:57:05.650
Since I was a kid,
I wanted to be just like you.

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:07.152
We all idolized you.

01:57:08.028 --> 01:57:11.948
It's crazy. Even my mom said
I looked just like you and shit, twin.

01:57:11.949 --> 01:57:15.118
- You could be my pops or some shit, man.
- I might be.

01:57:16.245 --> 01:57:18.329
You're from the same block, same hood.

01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:19.665
Shit, it's only right.

01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:24.126
You know, I've been doing
this rapping shit for the longest, B.

01:57:24.127 --> 01:57:26.255
Like, since I was a young 'un.

01:57:27.005 --> 01:57:28.924
Nobody never gave two fucks, though.

01:57:29.675 --> 01:57:32.928
Even my shorty, she was like,
"Nah, this shit ain't it."

01:57:34.221 --> 01:57:38.057
I just decided to give up
and shit, man, you know?

01:57:38.058 --> 01:57:40.101
When I looked at you,
I always tried to reach out,

01:57:40.102 --> 01:57:42.604
you was at your highest
and I was at my lowest.

01:57:44.398 --> 01:57:46.567
I said I was going
to bring you to hell with me.

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:50.237
And then, next thing you know...

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.991
like magic. Abracadabra. Poof.

01:57:55.033 --> 01:57:57.410
Every fucking label on my dick now

01:57:57.411 --> 01:58:00.329
trying to sign me,
chasing me and shit like that.

01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:03.541
Giving my lawyer
all type of crazy business offers

01:58:03.542 --> 01:58:07.129
and deals that you can only dream of, B.
But I said, "Fuck that shit, nah."

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:09.881
I want to sign with you, man.

01:58:09.882 --> 01:58:13.134
I want to be with you with
Stackin' Hits Records, man. Together.

01:58:13.135 --> 01:58:16.345
Look, man. I'm telling you,
like, you could produce for me

01:58:16.346 --> 01:58:19.141
on some Pharrell, Timbaland-shit
type shit, like...

01:58:19.933 --> 01:58:21.559
Man, we could be like...

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:23.562
Weezy and Birdman, word.

01:58:24.438 --> 01:58:28.025
Shit, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours
if you're with it.

01:58:28.525 --> 01:58:30.818
Bet you ain't know I fuck
with Stevie Wonder like that, huh?

01:58:30.819 --> 01:58:33.030
Yeah. You didn't listen to the whole song.

01:58:35.532 --> 01:58:38.243
You ain't the sunshine of my life,
that's for sure.

01:58:41.788 --> 01:58:43.040
I'm...

01:58:44.666 --> 01:58:46.209
I'm leaving Stackin' Hits.

01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:48.336
What? You is Stackin' Hits.

01:58:48.337 --> 01:58:51.214
I'm starting my own label.
A little something smaller, you know?

01:58:51.215 --> 01:58:55.092
Something I can have more control of,
give me more time to spend with my family.

01:58:55.093 --> 01:58:58.429
But more importantly,
or just as importantly, more time to...

01:58:58.430 --> 01:59:00.682
to concentrate on the music,
to get to the...

01:59:01.767 --> 01:59:03.100
Back to the music.

01:59:03.101 --> 01:59:06.562
Yo, focusing on the music
and getting back to the music?

01:59:06.563 --> 01:59:08.439
What's more important than the money?

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.067
You gonna go broke doing that shit.

01:59:13.445 --> 01:59:14.612
Yeah.

01:59:14.613 --> 01:59:18.116
Attention is the biggest form
of currency nowadays, B.

01:59:18.742 --> 01:59:23.663
Yo, you signing me would be the biggest
fucking deal in music history ever.

01:59:23.664 --> 01:59:24.957
Think about it.

01:59:25.707 --> 01:59:27.334
All money ain't good money.

01:59:35.801 --> 01:59:38.511
Come on, man. Don't look at me like that

01:59:38.512 --> 01:59:42.056
like I'm a mad man or some shit, man,
like I'm a piece of shit.

01:59:42.057 --> 01:59:45.268
I'm only playing the game
that y'all motherfuckers invented.

01:59:45.269 --> 01:59:48.897
Get on the wave, man.
Before it's too late. Ride the wave.

01:59:54.945 --> 01:59:55.946
Not interested.

01:59:57.614 --> 01:59:58.698
Not interested?

01:59:58.699 --> 02:00:01.242
Can't do nothing with your music.
It's not for me.

02:00:01.243 --> 02:00:03.287
What? You don't wanna see
a nigga on the top?

02:00:06.123 --> 02:00:08.249
You some hating-ass nigga for real, man.

02:00:08.250 --> 02:00:11.502
Yo, fuck you, you old-ass nigga.
Fuck you, B.

02:00:11.503 --> 02:00:12.753
Nigga, think about it.

02:00:12.754 --> 02:00:15.756
Before the kidnapping,
nobody gave two fucks about you.

02:00:15.757 --> 02:00:18.009
They forgot about
your washed-up ass, nigga.

02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:21.262
I saved your fucking career, nigga.
I brought you back, nigga.

02:00:21.263 --> 02:00:23.973
Me. That's who did that.
Yung Felon, nigga.

02:00:23.974 --> 02:00:26.184
Nobody else. Nigga, fuck you!

02:00:26.185 --> 02:00:28.477
I should've kidnapped your son.
And I ain't pop that...

02:00:28.478 --> 02:00:30.062
You lucky, nigga.

02:00:30.063 --> 02:00:32.607
That's why your bitch
on my visiting list, nigga!

02:00:32.608 --> 02:00:36.402
Fuck you, nigga!
Fuck you! Fuck you, motherfucker!

02:00:36.403 --> 02:00:38.988
You ain't shit without me, I made you!
Fuck you too!

02:00:38.989 --> 02:00:40.908
Get the fuck off me!

02:00:45.787 --> 02:00:47.164
Amen.

02:00:50.292 --> 02:00:54.504
- Are we really going to be all right?
- Yes, we are.

02:00:54.505 --> 02:00:56.881
We're gonna be uptight,
we're gonna be out of sight.

02:00:56.882 --> 02:01:00.009
Baby, everything is all right.

02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:01.761
I am being serious.

02:01:01.762 --> 02:01:04.388
- So am I.
- Please. Not time for jokes.

02:01:04.389 --> 02:01:06.517
- Are we good?
- Is James Brown?

02:01:07.518 --> 02:01:10.269
Is Barry White? Is Al Green?

02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:12.063
You!

02:01:12.064 --> 02:01:14.608
- Is Aretha Franklin?
- Is Aretha Franklin?

02:01:15.692 --> 02:01:18.403
Is Trey King?

02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:36.421
So...

02:01:38.966 --> 02:01:40.508
Pleasure to meet you.

02:01:40.509 --> 02:01:42.761
- My wife, Pam.
- Hello.

02:01:43.428 --> 02:01:47.515
My son, you know, Trey.
Trey says you're the next big thing.

02:01:47.516 --> 02:01:52.019
Oh, well, pleased to meet you all.

02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:55.565
This is my pianist, Ric'key.

02:01:55.566 --> 02:01:57.860
- How you doing, Ric?
- Pleasure to meet you.

02:02:02.739 --> 02:02:04.032
"Sula..."

02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:06.659
"Sula Janie Zimmie."

02:02:06.660 --> 02:02:11.080
That's correct. My mother loved
Toni Morrison and Zora Neale Hurston.

02:02:11.081 --> 02:02:13.207
<i>The Bluest Eye</i> is my favorite novel.

02:02:13.208 --> 02:02:15.877
Sounds like you come
from a very literate family.

02:02:15.878 --> 02:02:18.796
Not really. My father was a rolling stone.

02:02:18.797 --> 02:02:20.674
Pun intended.

02:02:22.426 --> 02:02:24.177
My family has always had
a music background.

02:02:24.178 --> 02:02:26.762
Singers, composers, musicians.

02:02:26.763 --> 02:02:28.681
And I actually wrote this song
I'm about to sing.

02:02:28.682 --> 02:02:30.808
Okay. You have a stage name?

02:02:30.809 --> 02:02:34.896
Sula, initial C, Sing.

02:02:34.897 --> 02:02:36.314
What does the C stand for?

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:37.357
"Can."

02:02:41.028 --> 02:02:43.196
All right, Sula "Can" Sing.

02:02:43.197 --> 02:02:45.573
You'd better be able to sing
if that's your name.

02:02:45.574 --> 02:02:47.200
You should find out.

02:02:47.201 --> 02:02:48.327
Let's find out.

02:05:23.774 --> 02:05:24.775
Come on.

02:05:44.419 --> 02:05:46.129
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

02:06:30.132 --> 02:06:31.924
And let the church say...

02:06:31.925 --> 02:06:33.426
Amen, amen.

02:06:33.427 --> 02:06:36.180
Amen. So, Sula...

02:06:37.431 --> 02:06:40.058
I see, you can...

02:06:40.851 --> 02:06:41.852
sing.

02:06:43.937 --> 02:06:45.396
What's the name of the song?

02:06:45.397 --> 02:06:46.857
"Highest 2 Lowest."

02:06:50.986 --> 02:06:52.904
Sula, do you believe in yourself?

02:06:52.905 --> 02:06:54.947
- Yes.
- Do you believe in me?

02:06:54.948 --> 02:06:56.908
- Yes.
- Do you believe you'll be successful?

02:06:56.909 --> 02:07:00.244
- Yes.
- Do you believe in having hard times?

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:01.621
'Cause that's what it'll be.

02:07:01.622 --> 02:07:03.623
And the hard times will
come from the good times.

02:07:03.624 --> 02:07:06.835
The hard times will come from success.
The hard times will come from the money.

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:09.212
And the mayhem follows.

02:07:09.213 --> 02:07:11.506
So, can you handle the mayhem?
Can you handle the money?

02:07:11.507 --> 02:07:13.758
Can you handle the success?
Can you handle the failure?

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:16.135
Can you handle the lovers?
Can you handle the memes?

02:07:16.136 --> 02:07:18.596
Can you handle everything
that there is in between?

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:20.932
That's the question I have for you.
Can you handle it?

02:07:20.933 --> 02:07:22.100
Yes.

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:28.065
I believe you.

02:07:28.815 --> 02:07:31.318
- Trey?
- I think we should go to studio tomorrow.

02:07:32.194 --> 02:07:34.570
- You ready?
- Mr. King, I was born ready.

02:07:34.571 --> 02:07:36.906
No, wait. We gotta talk about my cut, Dad.

02:07:36.907 --> 02:07:38.783
- I'm the one who discovered her.
- About your cut?

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:40.660
Pam, talk to your son.

02:07:40.661 --> 02:07:43.205
We'll get to that when
I'm co-chairperson of the board...

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:45.748
of our new label.

02:07:45.749 --> 02:07:48.794
- Family business.
- I like that. Family business.

02:07:49.670 --> 02:07:51.046
"Highest 2 Lowest."

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:55.342
Let's get to work.
