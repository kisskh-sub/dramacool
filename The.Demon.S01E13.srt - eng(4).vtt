No…

(Happiness)

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.000
Bow to heaven and earth.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.640
Bow to this auspicious moment.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.840
The husband and wife bow to each other.

00:01:45.475 --> 00:01:46.975
(Fan Awu)

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.187
(Shen Qinghe)

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.360
The ceremony is complete.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:00.879
Awu,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.959
from now on, you are my wife.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:08.759
Demon,

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.719
face your fate!

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.400
No!

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.240
How could this be?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.039
Exactly the same.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:03.080
How can it be exactly the same?

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.520
Could that dream have been

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.639
from a past life of mine?

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.240
Qinghe!

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.719
Save… save yourself…

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.319
No, I won't!

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.680
I'm not going anywhere!

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.759
We promised

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:31.439
we would be together forever!

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.520
Qinghe!

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.719
May we be together again
in another life…

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:43.719
Qinghe…

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:45.560
Qinghe…

Awu…

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.399
Dayao.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.839
Master.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.319
My time is running out.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.279
Once I return

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.839
the demon core inside me,

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.160
my life will end immediately.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.360
She lost a demon core,
causing her powers to be unbalanced,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.800
and her fear of water
even stronger than others of her kind.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.040
That's why she transforms

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.199
during rainy days.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.759
She is a rare Cat Demon
with two demon cores.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.079
Though she is a demon,

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.839
she carries an extraordinary mission.

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:22.879
And you are destined

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.000
to be her tribulation.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.959
That's why you sent me
to find the demon core.

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:36.120
Not to have her heal me,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.079
but to use my life

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:39.720
to end this disaster.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.959
My life was given to me by her.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.000
Rest assured.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:53.959
I won't sacrifice Dayao's happiness

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.279
for a fleeting moment of pleasure.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.160
Nor will I abandon Moyuan City

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.000
and its people.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.759
I accept my destiny,

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.240
and I want Dayao

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:08.199
to have a peaceful, complete life.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.600
Do you intend

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.439
to face this catastrophe

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:13.839
all on your own?

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.199
You might lose

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.639
everyone close to you.

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:21.279
When that happens,

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:24.879
you'll be all alone again.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.480
The happiness you long for,

00:08:29.199 --> 00:08:30.000
your loved ones…

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.759
It's all right.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:33.919
I can bear it.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.559
Shen Wangchen,

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:54.919
I'm giving you one last chance.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.960
If you agree to marry me,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.080
I will use all the power of my court

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:00.720
to eliminate the demons causing chaos

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.919
in the city.

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:03.559
I agree.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.519
If you continue to be stubborn,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.720
don't blame me for…

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.399
You…

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:14.200
You agree?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.240
Did he say yes?

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.879
Was he speaking to me?

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.240
Yes.

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:50.480
Shen Wangchen,

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:51.480
I love you.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.039
Dayao,

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:15.759
I've decided

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.799
to propose to Princess Huaiyang.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.559
Looks like someone

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.240
still doesn't understand the situation.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.080
Why are you proposing to her?

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.080
Are you that close now?

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.159
You shouldn't be

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:52.080
living here anymore.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720
Pack your things

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.519
and return to the fort.

00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.240
You…

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.639
- Mr. Shen…
- Young Master…

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960
Her Highness has spoken.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.320
Who dares defy her orders?

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:20.600
What's gotten into you?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.840
I told you.

00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:24.120
No one here

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.399
can harm me.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.840
If you hadn't stopped me,
I would have already…

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.559
Jiang Li.
