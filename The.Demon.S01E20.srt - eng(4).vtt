00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.280
Is anyone there?

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.680
Where's the shopkeeper?

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.159
I came to treat his illness.

00:01:38.519 --> 00:01:39.319
It's me.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.200
Mr. Shen, do you remember

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.760
saving a white cat?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.000
(I'm here repay your kindness.)

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.920
(What if I offered myself to you?)

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.280
Mr. Shen.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.120
Mr. Shen.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.879
Are you there?

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:15.759
Mr. Shen.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:17.560
Are you there?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
Master.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.680
Mr. Shen.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.840
I know.

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:46.840
I'm sorry for making you worried.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.919
This medicine
can only ease your coughing.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:53.752
It can't

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.360
heal your frail body.

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.080
It treats the symptoms, not the root.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080
Thank you for your concern.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.199
Life and death are fated.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:04.240
I've long been prepared.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.000
Even if short,

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.039
I will cherish it.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.120
I only hope
that you'll protect her for me

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.120
when I'm gone.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.800
Please.

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:21.599
Don't worry.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.120
She'll be fine.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.400
Did Master Shang come by?

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.520
Did he say

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:50.919
the demon core can be returned?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.639
That's right.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.280
That's great!

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.039
You have no idea

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:57.439
how heartbroken I've been

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.120
seeing you cough all the time.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.479
It's killing me!

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:05.960
Once you have both demon cores,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.680
you'll be the strongest demon

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.759
in this world.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.400
Don't forget what I taught you then.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.039
I remember it.

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.520
With you watching me,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.120
how could I go around doing evil?

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.600
Well,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.160
once I get my demon core back,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.800
I'll return to the fort in glory.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.000
I'll let my followers witness

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.959
the power of double demon cores.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.680
Momo.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.800
Momo!

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.879
Momo.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.879
Momo.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.360
You just recovered.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.879
Stop pushing yourself.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.000
Why did you save me?

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.600
I can never

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.319
become the Guardian again.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.160
Why does this dish taste
both bitter and salty?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.480
Jiang Li.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.279
There are no secrets between us.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.040
I can't taste anything anymore.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:46.600
Was it because
you tested those herbs for me?

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.800
You lost your sense of taste?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.439
I'm sorry!

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:02.839
It's all right.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.199
I chose this myself.

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:07.639
From now on,

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.079
I can't make delicious dishes anymore.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.399
Will you hate me for that?

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:14.079
What nonsense are you saying?

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.120
All right.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.480
Look.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.439
I'm just a mortal, aren't I?

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.879
The only spell I know

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:25.360
is making good food.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.959
But now,

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.360
I'm no longer able to do that.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.360
But I can do other stuff.

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:30.879
For example,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.959
I know

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.160
how to turn mushrooms into dried goods.

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:35.160
I know

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.000
how to tell poultry from wild animals.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.639
I also know

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.199
what to eat in each season
for nourishment.

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:40.959
Above all,

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.279
I can always

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:43.720
stay by your side.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.560
You're both human

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.439
and demon.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.560
You're much stronger than I am.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.360
Thus, guarding the fort

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.399
doesn't always mean
getting into a fight.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.560
You mean,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.079
I can protect the fort for Dayao

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.560
in my own way?

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:04.759
Of course.

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:31.639
Why are you always so brilliant?

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.799
Just combing my hair

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.039
makes my face blushed and heart race.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.360
I really want this moment to last.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.840
That's wonderful.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:51.879
Oh, right.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.279
Let me tell you.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.279
From now on, you must never

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:55.159
hide things from me.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:55.759
Understand?

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.399
Most importantly,
don't you leave without a word again.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.159
Yes.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:12.159
Whyâ€¦ Why are you
looking at me like that?

00:09:21.879 --> 00:09:23.320
(I want to remember your face.)

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.879
I was thinking...

00:09:37.639 --> 00:09:38.600
Were we like this too

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.960
in our past lives?

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.120
I find that infuriating.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.480
That dream is always fragmented.

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.360
I still don't know

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.639
what happened to Fan Awu and Shen Qinghe

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:49.039
in the end.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.519
How did the demon core

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.279
end up inside your body?

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:55.080
Let's get to sleep.

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:56.360
Maybe we'll dream of it.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.962
(Qinghe)

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:18.600
You foolish doctor!

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.039
And you dare call yourself
a famed physician?

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.360
You're actually living with a demon!

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.799
Indeed.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:22.840
You're a mere quack!

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.200
Get out of our city now!

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.000
Yes!

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.679
- Get lost!
- Scram!

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.440
It's those from the east of the city.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.360
I'll go settle the score with them.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.159
Awu.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.200
Don't do that.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.759
It's fine.

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.399
Let's just leave this place.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.200
Is our love

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.759
that intolerable?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.759
Qinghe.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:56.919
You need not give up anything for me.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.320
I'll leave alone.

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.080
Awu!

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:08.759
Are you really leaving me

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.120
because of those unreasonable people?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.320
I just don't want you

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.679
to be despised by the world
because of me.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.240
You were born

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.440
the purest soul in the world.

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:17.720
How could they...

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:22.879
It's all right, Awu.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.039
It's fine.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.960
Though there's so much beauty
in the world,

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.759
you alone are enough for me.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.399
I'll be fine.

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:33.320
Just don't leave me, all right?

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.120
It's fine.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:14.879
How silly of you, Awu.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.480
Without you,

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.440
how could I live on?

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.639
No!

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.279
It's all right.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.639
He...

00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:55.399
It's all right.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.559
How could he do such a foolish thing?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.879
Why would he take his own life?

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.679
Everything's fine.

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:02.960
Everything's fine.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.200
It's all over now.

00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:06.600
Shen Wangchen.

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:08.519
Can humans and demons

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.759
truly never be together?

00:13:11.159 --> 00:13:11.960
Now,

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.080
you're just like Shen Qinghe.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.759
Because of me,

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.360
you're scorned by the world.

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:21.399
It's all my fault.

00:13:22.639 --> 00:13:23.480
I'm sorry.

00:13:23.879 --> 00:13:24.679
It's all right.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:29.080
I'm not Shen Qinghe

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:30.600
and you're not Fan Awu.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.240
Let the past

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.360
stay in the past.

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:35.960
In this life,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.039
we will never

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.240
end up that way.

00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:45.039
Well, when I'm gone,

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.440
you must live well.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.519
That's an order.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.159
You must not disobey it.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.080
Yes.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.679
You must promise me too.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.639
If...

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.840
I mean,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.120
if I'm gone too,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.639
you must...

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.559
I won't let you die on me.

00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:26.840
(Xiao'er.)

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:28.600
(I'm sorry.)

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:31.919
(I'm now a dying man.)

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.759
Momo.

00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:47.919
Let me do it.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:48.879
You want grilled fish?

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.879
It's all right.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:50.600
I'll do it.

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:52.320
Why grill fish?

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:54.559
Dayao will be

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:56.159
back from the city soon.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.840
She's probably furious.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.639
Let's grill her a fish for nourishment.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.120
Leave it to me.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:01.919
There's too much smoke.
You should go outside.

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:03.639
Seriously, let me do it.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.240
All right.

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:15.360
Is that a burn?

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:19.360
Don't cry.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.600
If it hurts, wait here.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.639
I'll get you the ointment.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.759
Don't go!

00:15:23.759 --> 00:15:24.519
Come back.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.039
What's it?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.120
Actually, I've felt really uneasy

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.720
since last night.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.960
I feel like something bad

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.720
is going to happen.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:49.200
The time has come.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:52.879
The double demon cores will be mine!

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:54.960
They shall be mine!

00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.840
They shall be mine!

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.613
â™ªWhere did I lose my direction?â™ª

00:16:26.925 --> 00:16:29.338
â™ªOnly emptiness is leftâ™ª

00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:34.500
â™ªRestless, sleepless, we part waysâ™ª

00:16:34.638 --> 00:16:37.363
â™ªAs sorrow slowly grows withinâ™ª

00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:41.950
â™ªTears can't heal, smiles still acheâ™ª

00:16:42.325 --> 00:16:45.575
â™ªBecause my heart's with youâ™ª

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.025
â™ªYour gaze melted the hazeâ™ª

00:16:52.475 --> 00:16:59.338
â™ªWaiting so long for your returnâ™ª

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:07.488
â™ªThe setting sun reminds me of youâ™ª

00:17:07.988 --> 00:17:12.900
â™ªIf the clear sky is torn
by storm and rain one dayâ™ª

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.050
â™ªTears will flowâ™ª

00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:22.825
â™ªI will still wait here with no regretsâ™ª

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:30.688
â™ªWaiting so long for your returnâ™ª

00:17:31.225 --> 00:17:38.375
â™ªThe setting sun reminds me of youâ™ª

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:43.663
â™ªIn the amber desert,
you turn away with tears in your eyesâ™ª

00:17:44.025 --> 00:17:47.450
â™ªI'll welcome you back in a red dressâ™ª

00:17:48.063 --> 00:17:53.950
â™ªWaiting forever with no regretsâ™ª

00:17:55.663 --> 00:18:03.238
â™ªWaiting forever with no regretsâ™ª
