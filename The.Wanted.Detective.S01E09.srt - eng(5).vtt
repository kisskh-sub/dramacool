[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.940
[Episode 9]

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.310
I assume

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.350
the autopsy is almost done by now.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.400
Constable Zhong.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.300
Please have the people inside
open the door.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.680
What should we do?

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760
Constable Zhong, please.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.430
He's the one who stole Master's body!

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.220
Did the autopsy reveal anything?

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.470
Chief Fang.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.560
The victim did not die of illness.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.240
There are some doubts about the cause.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.870
Nonsense!

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.710
Master clearly died of illness.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.030
Since there are doubts,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.600
let's hear

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.030
what Coroner Feng has to say.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.240
What do you all think?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.730
I am Huo Dairong, Huo Zongyao's daughter.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.470
I agree with Chief Fang's suggestion.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.520
Let's first hear the autopsy results.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.360
If my father was truly murdered,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.130
I request the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.590
and the Secret Investigation Unit
to take charge

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.850
and uncover the truth.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.840
Alright.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.280
Please come in, everyone,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.810
and allow me to explain everything
in detail.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.190
You just said

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.840
there were two people involved in
stealing the body, right?

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.640
That's right.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.030
These are the two.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.040
Chief.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.950
Mo Chong.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.790
Are you going along with Zhong Xueman

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.720
in her nonsense?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.070
It's just that I... I heard that Xueman...

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.490
I'm just glad you're alright, Xueman.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.450
Coroner Feng,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.630
please share with everyone

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.190
the results of your autopsy.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.240
Yes, Chief.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
There are strangulation marks
on General Huo's neck.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.840
These weren't there before.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.540
What did you do to my husband?

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.560
What I used just now is

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.360
the most common kind of badger oil.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.560
Badger oil can remove cosmetic powder.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.830
The reason we didn't

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.510
notice

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.390
the wounds on General Huo's body before

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.290
was because someone

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.480
used a specific type of cosmetic powder

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
to cover them up.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.800
Someone wanted to disguise

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.360
the true cause of General Huo's death.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.600
But such amateur tricks

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.390
can't fool us coroners.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.159
The underside of General Huo's tongue

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.360
is swollen and dark purple,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.480
and there's hemorrhaging in his eyes.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.830
All these symptoms indicate

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.360
he died from asphyxiation.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.360
Combined with

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.020
the strangulation marks
on General Huo's neck,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.950
he was strangled to death.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:05.600
Darling...

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.190
Darling!

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.390
Darling!

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.750
Who would want to harm him?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.390
There's already evidence proving

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.800
General Huo was murdered.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.390
Does anyone have any further comments?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.560
Who could have done this to him?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.520
Who would go so far as to harm him?

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.430
Mrs. Huo, please accept my condolences.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.070
Since this is confirmed as a murder case,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.120
our Secret Investigation Unit

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.870
will surely see this case to the end

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.870
and bring justice to the Huo family.

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:41.600
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.360
Hold on.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.120
Don't think you can fool us so easily.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.040
Case investigation

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.630
is your duty,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.240
but Zhong Xueman's crime

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
cannot be let off so easily.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.240
What do you mean?

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.720
Are you going back on your word?

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.520
These are two separate matters.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.950
What,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.750
is the Second Division of
the Ministry of Justice

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.950
planning to show favoritism in public?

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.190
Since this matter started because of me,

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.830
please leave the investigation

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.630
to Constable Zhong and me.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.430
We'll uncover the truth

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.830
and make amends for our mistakes.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:11.950
What if the investigation

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.070
goes on for three to five years

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.270
without any results?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.390
What then?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.860
Well, let's set

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.390
General Huo's seventh-day memorial
as the deadline.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.070
If the case remains unsolved by then,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.310
we shall accept punishment ourselves.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.190
Or tomorrow,

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:24.920
you can go to the Ministry of Justice

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.510
to file a report
and convict Constable Zhong and me.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.070
No need to wait until tomorrow.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.530
We'll file the case today.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.360
Since this involves the daughter of
King Zhong of Constables

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.480
and the son of Chief Zhuge,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.510
the Ministry of Justice
will surely take this seriously.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.310
File the case!

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.070
Since things have come to this point,

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.270
let's proceed as Mr. Zhuge suggested.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:12.950
Thank you in advance, Coroner Feng.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.840
Once my father's case is solved,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.290
I will properly express my gratitude.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.950
No need for formalities.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.830
This is my duty,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.470
a small effort on my part.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.669
Zhong Xueman.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.929
Why does trouble follow you everywhere?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.400
Are you some kind of jinx?

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.240
And how did you end up

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.530
getting involved up with Zhuge Kongyun?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.870
It's because
I agreed to cooperate with them.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.870
What do the members of
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.870
think about this?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.480
This is my personal decision.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.320
It has nothing to do with
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.980
I just want to capture Yesha
as soon as possible.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.200
Look at you, so stubborn and unyielding.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.390
If I hadn't come today,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.600
how would you have handled this situation?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.200
I was reckless, Sir.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.600
I owe it to you this time, Chief Fang.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.550
Alright then.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.080
Cooperation it is.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.600
But one thing.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.720
Any lead you discover

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.670
while working with
the Secret Investigation Unit

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.670
must be reported to me immediately.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.270
I hope

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.950
you'll capture Xiao Beiming yourself.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.360
Understood.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.440
Mo Chong!

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.440
Yes, Chief.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.040
Miss Huo has really been through a lot.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.030
How tragic.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.000
Where's Beiming?

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.750
He...

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.270
I think he should be

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.480
home by now.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.370
Constable Zhong,
you don't play by the rules.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.540
To help you,

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.610
I even got myself dragged into it.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:03.550
Thanks a lot.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.480
Just this once. Don't expect it again.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.080
If there's a next time,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.050
not to mention I won't help you,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.520
our partnership in case investigation

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.150
will also be over.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.670
You're so petty.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.550
It depends on who I'm dealing with.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.360
With you,

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.480
I've been generous enough.

What did you say?

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.080
Master was murdered?

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.000
How could this be?

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:42.000
The Elite Constabulary Unit's coroner
has performed an autopsy

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.120
and confirmed that he was indeed murdered.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.600
Please don't be upset, Madam.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.910
Your health is already poor.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.240
He's not worth your distress.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.120
He was your father after all.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.670
And now,

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.580

Please don't hold a grudge against him
anymore,

will you?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.510
I cannot do that.

came from, Madam.

Let's not talk about this anymore.

You're tired too.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.910
Madam, you don't have to

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.840
stay up to make tea for him anymore.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.770
This teabag is useless now.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.900
I'll throw it away.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.390
Alright.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.480
Qing Ying.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.080
My Lady.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.440
After Mother finishes her porridge,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.790
make sure she rests early.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.510
Yes.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.250
Please have some porridge.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.030
Beiming.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:21.870
That was really close.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.380
I'm so glad you're back safely.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.200
Fortunately, you were quick-witted,
Beiming,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.910
otherwise the consequences

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:26.960
would have been unimaginable.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.120
This is also thanks to you

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.880
and Mo Chong.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.660
Is there any way to wake him up?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.700
Can you do that?

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.300
A few injections would do.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.130
Are you alright?

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.200
Why did I fall asleep

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.390
as soon as I opened the door?

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.960
Come on, get up first.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.790
You must have been too tired.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.150
Why are you here?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.270
That's not important.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.370
Right now, your junior Xueman

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.630
is in danger out there,

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.210
and only you can help her.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.630
Here,

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.600
put this on first.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.360
Wait...

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.550
I have a plan.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.720
Trust me.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.030
Please come in, everyone.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.000
I'll explain everything in detail.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:17.800
And that's how

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.750
I escaped through the back window
during the chaos.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.270
It was really close this time.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.600
I'm not worried about anyone else.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.630
I'm just worried that
Zhuge Kongyun might discover something.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.440
Besides,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.060
as soon as he entered Room Tu,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.440
he looked around everywhere

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.120
and even checked the corpse bed next door.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.000
He's always

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.750
been suspicion of us.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.120
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.150
There are many suspicious circumstances
surrounding General Huo's death.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.350
The entire Huo family

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.480
is questionable.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.550
That's right.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.020
After seeing the autopsy results,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.530
all the disciples of the Huo household

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.990
had strange expressions,

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.740
as if they were deliberately
hiding something.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.550
If General Huo

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.910
was really strangled to death,

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:52.320
his family members and disciples

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.650
are highly suspicious.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.270
Are you suggesting

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.510
that General Huo was very likely

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.840
killed by someone from his own household?

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.240
I can't say for certain,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.120
but tonight, at the Huo Mansion,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.380
I truly noticed a lot of strange details.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.790
That night, I went to
the Huo's household's disciples' quarters,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.080
where Huo Zongyao's disciples

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.120
reside.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:13.120
The interior is modeled

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.650
after military standards,

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.070
and all items

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.360
are arranged according to

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.690
military regulations.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.200
General Huo came from
a military background,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.550
so he brought
the strict military discipline

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:23.550
back home.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.390
Behind the sleeping quarters
is a training ground,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.870
with a large fighting platform
in the center.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.910
On that platform,

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.530
I found some bloodstains,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.820
which had accumulated

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.560
[Be Strict with Oneself]

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.870
from blood dripping over the years.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.270
It's obvious

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.440
that the sparring on that platform

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.300
was definitely not just for show.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.720
This indicates that Huo Zongyao,

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.360
when training his disciples,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.490
would make them fight for their lives.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.770
Besides, I also found

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.170
torture devices on the training ground.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.270
So these disciples

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.030
suffered inhuman treatment

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.320
year after year,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.360
until they couldn't take it anymore

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.240
and developed murderous intentions.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.120
Besides General Huo's disciples,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.200
Mrs. Huo

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.570
is also suspicious.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.550
Mrs. Huo's back is covered with scars,

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:08.360
which clearly shows

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.750
she had been abused.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.360
Also, someone whose husband just died

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.360
should be dressed more modestly, right?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.510
But her undergarment

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.910
was particularly vibrant.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.240
The way she was fixing her hair
in front of the mirror

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.510
seemed so relaxed and content,

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.360
as if her husband's death

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.630
was something to celebrate.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.120
Something's clearly off about this.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.810
If the abuse marks on Mrs. Huo's body

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.800
were all inflicted by Huo Zongyao,

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.750
then Mrs. Huo

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.350
also has a motive for murder.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:30.480
Not just Mrs. Huo,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.550
there was also

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.320
Xue Qianshan who wanted to set a fire.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.180
Let's set a fire

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.550
and force them out!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.120
Xue Qianshan clearly knew

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.080
General Huo's body was in the mortuary,

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.550
yet he still proposed to set a fire,

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.720
indicating he didn't care about the body

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.550
at all.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.840
More like he wanted
to destroy the evidence.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.170
There's one more person

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.010
I can't quite see through.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.340
You mean General Huo's daughter,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.360
Huo Dairong?

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.270
That young lady looked

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.390
gentle and fragile.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.840
She didn't seem like a bad person.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.240
She saw through

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.750
my identity at a glance.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.870
She's definitely no ordinary woman.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.910
Although you're in a Prosperity Robe,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.000
the boots you're wearing

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.130
are official boots.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.030
You are Zhong Xueman, right?

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.360
She's that good?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.840
Also, that day, she tricked me

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.290
into going to the Huo Mansion's bedroom,

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:14.360
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.790
making me run into Mrs. Huo

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.120
and expose my identity.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.240
After that, she deliberately
tried to curry favor with me.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.300
I can't tell what she's really after.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.030
This Miss Huo's clearly more complicated
than she looks.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:25.360
We don't have enough clues for now,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.620
so we need to visit the Huo Mansion again.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:29.720
Yeah, we should.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:41.750
Xueman.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.200
Beiming.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.850
Something troubling you?

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.280
It seems that Huo Zongyao's case

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.270
truly has nothing to do with Yesha.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.440
It does appear that way for now.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.270

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:33.380
The Five-Mineral Powder was originally

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.750
used to treat cold symptoms.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.400
But an official from the previous dynasty
discovered that

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.440
taking it could cause the body
to feel overheated

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.790
and the mind to become unusually clear,
causing hallucinations

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.250
and a feeling of euphoria.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.640
Under his influence,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.550
it became widely used.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.000
But later, it was discovered

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.750
that this drug causes chronic poisoning,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:48.960
and many long-term users

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960
lost their lives.

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:50.960
So in our dynasty,

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.550
it's classified as a banned drug.

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.810
It's hallucinogenic?

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.270
Are you suggesting

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.470
General Huo died while hallucinating?

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.510
Very likely.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.550
General Huo was highly skilled
in martial arts.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.720
If he suddenly unleashed
his internal energy on himself,

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.960
even his survival instinct

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.620
couldn't reverse the damage.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.510
Just by looking at the surface,

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:08.110
I have no way

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.370
to verify your theory.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.240
I need to perform an autopsy.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.030
That's okay.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:12.750
Zhuge Kongyun

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:14.160
should be questioning people
at the Huo Mansion.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.220
We still have time.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.590
Xueman?

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.830
The Secret Investigation Unit is here
to investigate on imperial orders.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:32.960
Who do you want to investigate?

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.690
Huo Zongyao.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.500
Huo Zongyao again?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.720
Xueman.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.750
Coroner Feng just arrived earlier,

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.680
and he's still here.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.750
Why is he here again?

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.550
I have no idea.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.490
[Secret Investigation Unit]

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:53.850
[Room Tu]

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.490
What are you doing here?

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.930
What do you mean?

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.990
I should be the one asking that.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.960
Why are you here?

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.680
I...

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.270
Last night,

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.640
I realized that

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.310
there might be something strange
about the body,

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.450
so I came back

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.000
to re-examine it.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:44.720
What's strange?

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:45.640
General Huo

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.120
might have actually

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.740
strangled himself to death.

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:56.440
Wait.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:57.510
What are you doing?

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.070
We can't perform the autopsy yet.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.810
You startled me. What's wrong?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.920
If General Huo really

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.000
strangled himself to death,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.240
those in the Huo household
must know about it.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.300
Otherwise,
they wouldn't have tried to hide

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.360
the strangulation marks on his neck.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.960
Zhuge Kongyun is too clever.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.270
They won't be able to hide it from him,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.550
and he'll definitely come here

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.000
to verify with an autopsy.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.270
Zhuge Kongyun?

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.900
Is he really that good?

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.880
He should already be

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.940
on his way here now.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.680
W-What should we do then?

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.640
Do as I say.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:23.920
Hallucinogenic drug?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.590
Yes,

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.480
but I need to perform an autopsy

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.920
to verify this theory.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.370
Then go ahead and do it.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.830
What's that supposed to mean?

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.160
The autopsy process

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.680
might be unpleasant to watch.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.750
You two might want to look away.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.680
We're all constables here.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.440
What's the big deal about an autopsy?

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.920
Why would we not be able to handle it?

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.510
Well,

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.640
Mr. Zhuge,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.160
you surely have exceptional courage.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.960
But the last time we performed an autopsy,

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.270
Constable Zhong felt sick

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.270
for several days.

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.110
So the great Constable Zhong

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.350
is scared of this?

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.920
I'm a woman after all.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.000
I can't stand watching autopsies.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.660
What's so strange about that?

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.590
If you hadn't mentioned you're a woman,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.750
I would have almost forgotten about it.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.750
Since you can't stand watching it,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.510
then don't.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.400
Cut the crap.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.480
Since Li Xiao wasn't lying,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.590
I'll return to the Huo Mansion
to continue the interrogation.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.450
Let me know when you have results.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.130
Let's get started.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:52.120
[Morgue]

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:13.400
Beiming.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.170
Is this really safe?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:15.920
Zhuge Kongyun

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:16.960
is being kept busy by Feng Qingzhuo,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.090
so I still have time.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.110
How about

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.240
I go with you?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.270
That way, if something goes wrong,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.130
we can flee the capital together.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.680
You've really thought of everything,
haven't you?

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.440
Of course.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.110
I'm now

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.750
an old hand at this.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.750
I can take you,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880
but let me ask you.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.590
Since I'm using your identity

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.880
to investigate now,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.020
whose will you use?

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.000
Jiang Yi's?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.160
No, Jiang Yi is a bit too old,

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.880
and Fang Yin is a bit too ugly.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.010
Stay home before you think it through.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.790
Fang Tianzheng's identity will do, right?

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.560
I think he's acceptable.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.900
Mr. Zhuge,

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.400
maybe you should go outside
for some fresh air.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.800
I can handle things here.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.920
No need.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:58.070
Mr. Zhuge, your dedication

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.440
is truly touching.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:01.860
How about this?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.830
I have a bottle of pills in my box

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:06.070
that might help you feel better.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:11.070
This one?

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.920
No,

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:13.270
it's the long one.

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:19.070
This one?

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.510
Yes, that's the one.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.270
What is this?

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.030
This pill is called
the Taste-Blocking Pill.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:26.920
After taking it,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.070
for two hours,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.160
it can temporarily block

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.440
your sense of taste and smell,

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:31.920
so you won't detect any odors.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.250
Mr. Zhuge, you'll feel more comfortable.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.030
This pill is a special formula

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.160
I developed myself.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.770
I wouldn't be willing to

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.230
share it with just anyone.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.200
Recently,

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.160
I've developed

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.070
a new type of pill that can

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.330
nourish yin and strengthen the kidneys.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.000
Young Master.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:51.310
This won't be

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.000
like the Five-Blood Pill from last time,
will it?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.480
That was an accident last time,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.680
a misunderstanding.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.920
Now that we're in the same boat,

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.110
I wouldn't lie to you even a bit.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.920
How is it?

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.670
I didn't lie to you, did I?

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.410
Please wait a moment, you two.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.980
Li Xiao said General Huo lived
a glorious life,

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.580
yet his death was so strange.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.440
Those in the Huo household

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.400
didn't want him to be gossiped about

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.070
and lose his dignity after death,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.830
so they covered up the marks
with cosmetic powder

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.560
and claimed he died of illness.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.640
If Feng Qingzhuo can verify

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.400
that there were hallucinogens
in General Huo's body,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.260
the Huo household
will surely be held accountable.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.200
Who could it be?

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.550
Let's meet them one by one

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.150
and see what they're hiding.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.440
What should we do

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.040
if Zhuge Kongyun comes back?

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.570
With Feng Qingzhuo there,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.900
he can buy us some time.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.880
Constable Zhong,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.680
who is this?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.920
This is Constable Tong Shuang
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.030
Since time is of the essence,

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.200
Mr. Zhuge and I

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.790
are investigating separately.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.390
Greetings, Constable Tong.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640
Constable Zhong.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.270
Does the autopsy confirm my statement

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.750
that Master died by suicide?

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.270
Mr. Zhuge is still examining.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.500
There are still many suspicious points
about the body

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:14.350
that haven't been clarified.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:15.510
However, before that,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:16.230
I'd like to meet

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.270
those who were present

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:19.270
on the night of General Huo's death.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.200
What's wrong?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.660
Is that inconvenient?

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.790
No.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.050
Please come with me.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.960
Senior Xue is not in the mansion today.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.030
He left early this morning.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.640
Junior, please inform Senior Xue that

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.840
people from the Elite Constabulary Unit
came for a visit.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.550
Please.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:01.150
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.290
Madam, Constable Zhong

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:10.310
from the Elite Constabulary Unit
requests to see you.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:14.400
Madam?

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.720
Master passed away suddenly,

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.400
and Madam is overwhelmed with grief.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.510
She's feeling unwell today

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:21.680
and cannot receive visitors.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.350
Everyone,

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.120
please see yourselves out.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.510
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:31.880
How about you two

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.260
come back another day?

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.090
Young Master Li.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:34.920
Would it be possible for you

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.320
to show us your quarters?

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:40.960
Please.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.510
This is my residence.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.080
Feel free to look around.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.110
Young Master Li, when did you

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.830
become General Huo's disciple?

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.030
Have you ever gone to battle
with General Huo?

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.400
I feel ashamed to say this,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.160
but I only became his disciple
three years ago.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.030
Since I became his disciple late,

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.550
I never went to the battlefield.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.590
Unlike Senior Xue,
who comes from a military background

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.270
and has been to battle with Master.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.000
Fortunately, Master favored me,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.720
so I could use my mediocre knowledge

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.190
to help manage his household affairs.

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.760
Manage his household affairs?

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.280
Don't you practice martial arts,
Young Master Li?

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.480
I know some martial arts,

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.480
but I'm not as skilled as
my fellow disciples.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.110
I heard that
General Huo valued martial skills greatly

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.550
when taking disciples.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:20.550
Guess he saw you

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.510
in a different light, Young Master Li.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.230
You must be exceptionally talented.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.780
Constable Zhong, you flatter me.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.440
No, don't!

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.400
What's wrong, Young Master Li?

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:38.670
This blade is sharp.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.870
Please be careful not to hurt yourself.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.830
It's alright.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.510
This blade is exquisitely crafted,

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.110
truly hard to put down.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.900
However, Young Master Li,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.560
why do you hang this blade
at your bedside?

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.280
A blade hanging over your head

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.540
seems rather unlucky.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.230
This blade

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.280
was a gift from my family.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.320
I hang it by my bed

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:13.510
as a constant reminder of my family.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.550
I see.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.910
I apologize for my presumption.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.670
My residence is in disarray.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:22.630
Please forgive the mess.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.110
I've heard that General Huo

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.480
was usually extremely strict
with his subordinates

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.920
and even went so far
as to physically abuse them.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.840
Is that true?

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:33.440
My late master

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.400
came from a military background.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.630
People trained in martial arts
tend to be stern,

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.710
which is quite normal.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.880
Besides, a general

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.760
can't be too soft with soldiers.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.400
But calling it abuse

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.660
is definitely an overstatement.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.280
And was there anything unusual about

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.940
General Huo's daily routine?

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.960
The General had been retired
for quite some time,

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.510
and he kept a very regular schedule.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.440
He even ate his meals with us disciples,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.040
nothing out of the ordinary.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.190
Is Miss Huo at home?

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.890
Could you take us to see her?

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.230
Okay, I'll take you.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.110
Thank you.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:07.960
What did you find?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.630
General Huo's brain tissue

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.760
is riddled with holes like an ant colony.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.960
This is the result of long-term use

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.590
of some kind of hallucinogenic drug

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.960
that causes this characteristic damage.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.440
Long-term use?

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.320
Cover it up!

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.030
Although I can't identify

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.150
the exact drug,

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.440
it's clear that he had been taking it
for several months,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.000
possibly even half a year.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.030
Only then would the brain tissue

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.830
develop this kind of condition.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.920
But after taking it for so long,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.880
how could General Huo not have noticed

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.140
he was being poisoned?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.190
Either he was murdered—

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.920
the killer administered

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.030
small doses of poison daily,

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:47.690
so General Huo didn't notice,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.150
and in the end, the accumulated dose

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:50.150
drove General Huo

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.590
to take his own life
in a hallucinated state;

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:51.960
or it was like the situation

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.840
with the Five-Mineral Powder
from the previous dynasty,

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:55.440
that General Huo became addicted

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.800
and couldn't control
his daily consumption,

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.190
and it eventually killed him.

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.230
Regardless of which theory is correct,

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:01.800
we need to go to
the Huo Mansion to investigate.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.550
Come with me.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:03.400
Me?

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.450
I don't know anything about
hallucinogenic drugs.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.320
Up ahead

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.170
is Madam Feng's residence
in the East Courtyard.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:17.510
Steward Li.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.500
Lord Zhuge is here?

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.150
Mr. Zhuge has brought someone here,

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.630
requesting to inspect Master's pharmacy.

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:28.680
Would you two prefer to

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:29.920
go meet with Mr. Zhuge with me,

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.320
or continue investigating
the East Courtyard?

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.070
Young Master Li,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.550
please go attend to Mr. Zhuge first.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.960
We'll look around a bit more.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.220
Then I'll take my leave

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.140
and won't accompany you further.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.440
They're going to check the pharmacy.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:46.150
It seems the body

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.840
truly contained hallucinogens.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.370
Zhuge Kongyun has arrived.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.030
If we continue our investigation,

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:52.690
how should you get away later?

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.030
He must have brought Feng Qingzhuo
with him,

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.510
who can buy us some time.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.250
The East Courtyard is where Miss Huo

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.510
and Madam Feng reside.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.150
Miss Huo's behavior

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.880
is puzzling even to me.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.840
Since we're already here,

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.170
we must go investigate.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:06.800
But...

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.590
Don't worry.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:09.250
It won't take long.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.320
Li already sent someone to inform us

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.920
that Constable Zhong would be coming.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.070
Madam is unwell

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.360
and resting inside,

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:20.550
and she asked me to wait for you here.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.590
Qing Ying, you may leave now.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:24.360
I'll handle this.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:24.960
Yes.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.440
Constable Zhong,
if you have any questions,

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.550
please feel free to ask.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:28.920
I will certainly tell you
everything I know

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.150
and hold nothing back.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.280
Thank you, Miss Huo.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.200
And who is this?

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.080
I'm Tong Shuang, a constable from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.010
Constable Tong, please have some tea.

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:56.690
Why do you keep staring at him?

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.860
It's quite the coincidence.

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:04.590
Constable Tong's appearance

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.360
closely resembles

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.020
an old friend I once held dear.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.330
That's indeed a coincidence.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.320
May I ask where

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.670
this old friend of yours

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.800
is now, Miss Huo?

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.190
He left on a long journey

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.590
and hasn't returned yet.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.400
We haven't seen each other
for quite some time.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.510
I heard from Young Master Li that

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.880
on the night of General Huo's death,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.480
you were also present, Miss Huo,

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.360
and that the wounds on General Huo's body

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.080
were also covered up by you,

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.760
Miss Huo, with cosmetic powder.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.590
Is that true?

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.520
Yes, that's correct.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.590
Since you knew
the cause of the General's death,

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:46.320
why did you lie to me that night?

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.730
Since you've already concluded

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.440
that my father strangled himself,

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.300
why bother questioning me again?

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.590
Because there are still doubts
surrounding the case.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:56.720
Of course there are.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.920
My father was always calm and composed,

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.580
with no troubles whatsoever.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.200
Why would he suddenly take his own life?

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.590
Although I witnessed it with my own eyes,

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.650
what one sees isn't always the truth.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.760
So regarding my father's death,

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.230
I also have my doubts.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.630
Everything I told you that day,
Constable Zhong,

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.110
was completely true,
without a single false word.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:17.510
So why didn't you speak up

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.670
during the autopsy?

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:22.290
My Lords, please understand.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.760
Although I'm the heiress
of the Huo family,

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.230
I have very little influence

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.800
within this household.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.840
What I did that day

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.190
was purely for self-preservation.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.710
Thankfully, you officers
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.510
are brave and fearless

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.910
in uncovering the truth,

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:42.710
giving hope that my father's death cause
may be brought to light.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:45.360
I am deeply grateful to both of you.
