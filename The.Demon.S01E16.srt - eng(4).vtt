00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.000
Who put that vase there?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.120
It's not well placed at all!

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.040
This red cloth.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.640
Hang the red cloth

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.040
there!

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.879
Can't you see it's empty there?

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.120
You're unbelievable.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:14.525
Oh my God!

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.799
Just get to work already!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.959
Look, dear.

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.640
The Princess is nothing but bossy.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.120
Will Chen be able to put up with her?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.359
Who placed the food here?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.799
Look at how meager it is.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.400
Will it be enough

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.000
for the whole household?

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:28.000
Well...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What are you looking at?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.799
I...

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.480
Do something!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.599
Yes,

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.680
let's get to work!

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.040
You're all fools!

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.120
What is all this?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.879
What a troublesome woman.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.519
Why is it so slippery here?

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.840
What if I slipped

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.200
tomorrow?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.480
Your Highness.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.680
Well,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.120
what else do we need here?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
You're actually asking me that?

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.680
Just see to it!

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.319
I'm telling you.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.159
This will be the most luxurious
wedding chamber

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.760
in Moyuan City.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.519
Make sure you make that happen!

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.439
Got it!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.200
Hang the lanterns!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.480
What a bunch of good-for-nothings!

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.719
Wangchen.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.199
Look,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.599
I'm all tired.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.599
Shall we

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.360
take a stroll in the backyard?

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.439
Sure.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.120
Let's go.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:36.560
Wangchen.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.879
Ever since I met you,

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.360
I...

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.039
Your Highness.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:44.960
Have you forgotten

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.990
I suffer from some peculiar ailment?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.080
But...

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.199
But...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.719
But I don't care!

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.000
You demoness!

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.400
Fan Dayao.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.919
How could you be so stubborn?

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:29.439
Guards.

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.319
Get her out of here!

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.120
Hold on!

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.719
Coming, Young Master!

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:34.680
Your Highness!

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.039
Could...

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.280
Could it be you're really a demon?

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.919
You managed

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.919
to push me all the way here!

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.319
You're overthinking, Your Highness.

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:47.520
She's a mere

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.919
uncultured commoner.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.319
Let's go now,

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.240
Your Highness.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.319
You're in

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.120
a rather bad shape.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.800
Wangchen, please pardon me

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.120
for my embarrassing state.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.479
Let's go.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.840
Shen Wangchen.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.840
As a good chief,

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.199
not only am I knowledgeable,

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.000
humane, and prestigious,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:19.319
but I've also learned
to be patient and composed.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.800
I can let it all slide

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.000
and give you another chance.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.199
Nobody cares.

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:31.439
See the guest out, Mr. Zhen.

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.240
Wangchen.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.360
Let's go.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.439
Please leave,

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.639
Young Madam.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120
Well, Young Madam,

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.240
just what's the matter

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.639
with Young City Lord?

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.399
How could he do that to you?

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.519
The Princess

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:12.720
has turned the place

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.800
upside down.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.199
She's been driving me

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.920
crazy.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.360
You must hang in there.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.920
You have our support,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.600
so don't ever give up.

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:24.720
The Young City Lord

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.920
is truly unbelievable.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.439
He's a womanizer

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.399
and an ingrate.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.240
If it hadn't been for...

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.959
Mr. Zhen.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.240
Stop it

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.079
or I'll beat you up.

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.000
Let's drop the subject.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.560
Let's drop it.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240
For decades, I'm a demon slayer

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.680
in Moyuan City,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.199
protecting its people.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.959
To my surprise, as the City Lord,

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.480
you've put the people in danger

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:08.480
by sheltering a demon.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:09.800
We still don't know

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.360
if that's true.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.639
If what you said is true

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.879
and the demon is here in my residence,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.879
I'll act accordingly.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.120
If you're spewing nonsense

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.879
to cause a scene here,

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:21.439
Dayao.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.759
I won't let it slide.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.480
Run.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.360
It's her!

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:29.279
That's the demoness!

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.600
Stop talking nonsense

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.680
unless you have evidence!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.480
I had a duel with her.

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.680
It's all thanks to her
that I'm injured.

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:39.240
Many saw

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.079
how she hurt me

00:06:41.325 --> 00:06:42.686
on that day.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:43.680
After that,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.879
there was a demon doing evil at night.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.879
It went missing not long after a report
was made at the yamen.

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:49.959
It's you

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:51.600
who have kept her in check.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.040
If it were her doing,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.240
I'd like to know

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.920
what evil deed

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.279
you've done.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:57.680
Me?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.279
Of course I was trying
to capture the demon.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.319
Liar!

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:03.199
You mistook my bunny for a demon.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.759
You know nothing about demons at all.

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.240
I won't let you hurt Dayao.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.560
Indeed.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:11.920
If he can't tell

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.160
animals and demons apart,

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.199
he's an unreliable demon slayer!

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:15.920
That's right.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.639
Children

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.439
don't lie after all.

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.199
Certainly.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.360
Children never lie.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.959
Come here, kid.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.839
It's my fault

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:24.800
for hurting your bunny.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.839
But let me ask you a question.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.839
Did this woman

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:29.600
say

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.879
she's the most powerful demon?

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:33.920
Yes.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.759
Dayao

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.480
is the strongest demon.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.639
She's brilliant,

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:38.680
and she stands up

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.040
to injustice.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.399
Something's off.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.800
The City Lord has been muddle-headed

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.279
in sheltering a demon.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.879
Today, we shall take matters
into our own hands!

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.519
Stop it!

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.519
Just come at me!

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.920
Don't worry,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.079
I won't resort to violence.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.279
That's right.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.480
I'm the most invincible demon.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.920
So just come at me.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.240
Do you think

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.879
I can't do anything about you?

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.959
Watch out, dear!

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.319
Help me up!

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.720
Run!

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.680
Let's go now!

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:33.879
I'm sorry, Dayao.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.159
Did I say anything wrong?

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:38.879
You were right.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.519
I'm the strongest demon

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.879
who stands up to injustice.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.120
Let's go home.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.360
Goodbye, Dayao.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.279
My mother is telling me to go home.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.360
Chen.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.519
Quick, let's go.
