[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.860
[3rd Year of Xingwen]

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.509
[Morgue, Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590
In the third year of Xingwen,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.710
when the Secret Investigation Unit
had not yet been formed,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.509
I was full of passion

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.090
to uphold justice

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.710
and joined

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.170
the Elite Constabulary Unit
as a constable.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.690
At that time,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.750
there was a serial murder case.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.680
Draw portraits based on bone structure?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.520
These are

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.970
the portraits of the three dead women?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.510
Rookie,

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.140
are you fooling us?

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.110
What are you drawing now?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.760
The murderer.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.730
You've seen him?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.680
No.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:44.650
Then how can you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.180
draw him in such detail?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.890
Based on the wounds on the bodies

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.030
and Deputy Chief Zhong's

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.320
deduction of the killer...

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.160
The knife was thrust upward
from the lower right

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.079
into the heart.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:53.920
These three

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.200
victims whose faces were skinned

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.200
were all female.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.340
If the killer

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.079
were taller than them,

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.510
or even about their height,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.110
the angle of the stab wound

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.550
wouldn't be like this.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.670
In other words,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.600
this killer is very likely

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.510
much shorter than the victims.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.970
The killer is a shortie.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.110
Also, considering

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.320
the victims' bone structure

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.790
and the killer's face-skinning behavior,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.250
I drew it as my assumption.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.990
Assumption?

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.620
You can draw him just from an assumption?

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.890
As violent as the murderer is,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.360
he must harbor immense resentment.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.920
And these women's faces

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.079
were all very beautiful.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.510
He skinned their faces

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.480
to destroy that beauty,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.360
venting his hatred.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.640
So the killer's face

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.760
has likely caused him

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.200
great suffering.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.360
He must've led a miserable life

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.670
without respect,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.079
until he ended up

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.710
as a madman

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.390
pleasing himself by killing.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.390
Wait, just with these portraits

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.390
and your words,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.950
how can you be so sure

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.410
that this is the killer?

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.760
Once we catch him,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.040
we'll figure out if I'm right.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.760
Is this also a site
where you dumped bodies?

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.390
Yes.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.600
Handcuff him.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.950
Go.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.230
You drew this?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.040
Impressive.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.160
With just these few clues,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.270
you managed to draw

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.480
such an accurate portrait.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.079
Genius!

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.149

pay my respects, Deputy Chief.

Great!

That was when

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.350
I met Zhong Yunchi.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.680
From that day on,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.560
we became the best partners

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.470

He was truly a genius.

Together, we solved

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.510
countless cases

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.560

the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.200
rose to fame.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.940

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.210
and King Zhong of Constables?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.580
There was a group of felons

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.880
being hunted by our unit.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.710
To save Zhong Yunchi,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.640
I was captured by them.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.470
To vent their anger,

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.150
they cut off my right hand

and blinded my left eye.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.880
where should we hang this plaque?

In the study.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.830
The study? That won't do!

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.830
Let's hang it in the front hall!

But not a single person helped me.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.530
where he doesn't ask anything

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.560
and draw

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.860
what Miao Yun looks like now,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.140
just a few of you

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.270
couldn't possibly find the man

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:05.590
in this portrait within several days.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.170
So I wasn't planning to ask you

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:08.430
to turn to your father.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.500
Then what do you want?

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.680
Father.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:15.730
Come in.

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.490
Why are you here again?

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.330
Father,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.290
after careful consideration,

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.230
I think there's something

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.450
I must say.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.510
Go ahead.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.860
King Zhong of Constables

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.330
spent his whole life
doing righteous things.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.010
When he let you leave back then,

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.750
could it have been for your own good?

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.830
Nonsense.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.670
You suffered from such a disaster

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.470
and kept a low profile for years.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.990
His Majesty formed
the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.100
such an important institute,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.770
and the Ministry of Justice
recommended several candidates.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.260
Haven't you ever wondered

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.170
why this position

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.370
was given to you?

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.850
What are you trying to say?

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.140
I found this
from the Imperial Secretariat,

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.670
which records discussions

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.010
between His Majesty
and King Zhong of Constables

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.010
before the establishment

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.940
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.330
After reading it,

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.040
you might have a different perspective.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.630
[His Majesty said, "Zhuge Tong was not
recommended by the Ministry of Justice.]

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.350
Zhuge Tong?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.100
But the Ministry of Justice

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.750
doesn't have this person

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.150
on their submitted list.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.340
Zhong,

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.050
why do you

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.770
recommend him?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.640
Your Majesty,

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.670
the Secret Investigation Unit will

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.050
not only work
with the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.600
to handle major cases in the capital

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.240
but also be responsible
for monitoring officials

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.050
and protecting the imperial family.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.450
The position of its Chief

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.270
requires not only meticulous thinking

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:03.530
and insight into human nature,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.800
but also

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.840
a loyal and resolute heart.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.270
I firmly believe

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.740
there is no one more suitable

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.390
than Zhuge Tong.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.940
I've heard

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:16.340
that Zhuge Tong
was previously harmed by villains,

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.410
left disabled and blind,

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.310
no longer as capable as before.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:23.310
Can he truly fulfill
such a weighty responsibility?

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:24.310
Your Majesty,

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.070
he worked with me for years.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.390
I know him well.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:31.700
His abilities

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.980
can never be undermined
by his physical disabilities.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.100
In terms of insight into human nature

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.210
and strategic foresight,

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.910
of all the people I've known in my life,

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:38.990
none can outshine him.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.190
["Tong's talent even dwarfs mine."]

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:40.510
Even I pale

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.880
in comparison to him.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.980
The Ministry of Justice reported

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.790
that you had already removed Zhuge Tong

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.910
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.820
If he is truly as capable

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:51.670
as you claim,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.030
why did you let him go?

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.580
This is a misunderstanding.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.270
A misunderstanding?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.670
I never doubted his abilities,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.510
nor did I intend to dismiss him.

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.960
But since I succeeded

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.310
as Chief of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:05.460
I've made too many enemies.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.550
He is my closest friend,

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.980
and he's already disabled.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.310
If I placed him in danger again

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.670
and something happened to him,

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.330
I could never forgive myself,
not even in death.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.550
You were trying to protect him?

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:19.080
I intended

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.430
to keep him away from chaos temporarily

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.340
to calm him down

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.910
and then talk things through.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.220
Unfortunately, at that time,

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.550
with his physical injuries

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.860
messing up his emotions,

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.270
I failed to have a proper conversation
with him in time,

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.030
leading to his deep grudge against me

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.130
and resulting in today's situation.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.150
Now I see.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.710
Your Majesty,

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.220
I pledge my life as a guarantee

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.550
that Zhuge Tong will not
betray your trust.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.700
If he cannot fulfill his duties

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.340
as the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.340
I will bear the punishment
for deceiving you.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.550
I beg you, Your Majesty,
to grant Zhuge Tong

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.670
another chance to prove his worth.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.800
No way.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:00.240
Absolutely impossible.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.870
If this were true,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.510
why wouldn't he have told me in person?

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.280
Because my master said

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:09.030
you were too proud.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.190
If you had known it,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.030
you would have seen it as sympathy
and rejected it for sure.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.550
If you continued to hide away back then,

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.300
it'd be a loss

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.100
to the imperial court
and the entire Qi Kingdom.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.910
So he never told you.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:19.310
Guards.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.280
Guards!

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:21.980
Father,

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.510
before I came in,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.880
I had already dismissed

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.790
all the guards outside.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:26.790
Foolish!

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.950
How dare you?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.670
Father.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.310
Make way!

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.190
Kongyun.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.100
Chief Zhuge,

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:49.670
I came to see you today

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.180
with no intention to resist,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.010
nor any thought of escape.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.310
What do you want?

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.540
I want you to make a decision.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.820
A decision?

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.990
I understand your prejudice

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.390
against me and my master.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.100
My master rarely got drunk,

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.630
but on those few occasions,

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.030
he would talk to himself,

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.550
saying he owed you an apology.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.190
He was waiting for a chance

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:13.650
to bring some wine, invite you

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.270
to the lakeside where you first met,

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.030
and apologize to you properly.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.610
Unfortunately, my master

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.100
wouldn't have that chance anymore.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.190
You came to see me

00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.310
just to talk about

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.210
these old stories?

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.370
Haven't you always wanted to know

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.020
why Chief Fang

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.280
risked his life

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.540
to free me?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.310
If you wish,

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.560
I can tell you

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.380
everything

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.620
I know.

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.320
But once you know the truth,

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:45.620
your life

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.400
will no longer be in your hands.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.880
If you choose not to hear me out,

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.780
I'll place my life at your mercy.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.320
You can arrest me or kill me

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.150
as you like.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.820
Yun,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.980
did you already know

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.770
what he's going to say?

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.730
Is that why

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.150
you've been openly

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.190
and secretly helping

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.850
the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.820
Father,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.110
I've already made up my mind.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.460
What I can tell you is

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.370

But as you said,

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.820
that's what a "normal person" would do.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.860
So it was normal for him

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.990
to eat that much without spitting it out.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.620

he might actually be a real fool.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.120
Did you betray me?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.070
I didn't!

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:19.860
I didn't.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.030
Really?

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.660
Really!

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.270
They all think I'm a fool.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.550
N-No one would notice me.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.860
You're lying!

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.140
-How dare you attack me?
-I dare not!

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.340
I dare not do it again!

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.710
I'm fed up with this filthy mask.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:54.470
Miao Yun,

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.600
shall we have a talk now?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.620
I'm not the man

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.550
you're looking for,

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.790
I have nothing to do with him!

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.180
You know

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.270
who we're looking for?

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.030
Yesha.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.030
Yesha.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.580
Miao Jie was Yesha.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:08.860
He's already dead.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.620
What was the purpose

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:06.200
of building this secret chamber?

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.420
Killing.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.520
I killed many, many people.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.900
Since I was a child,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.330
he would bring many

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.360
condemned prisoners out of nowhere

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.670
to this place

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.430
and make me fight them.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:46.910
The scars on my body

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.700
and the wounds on my legs

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.920
were all caused by it.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.140
Did he tell you anything?

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.900
Haiya.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.980
He said that we all came from Haiya,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.310
while the Qi Kingdom

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.820
destroyed everything we had,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.990
and we survived

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.030
all for revenge on the Qi Kingdom.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.620
So you're the second Yesha?

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.230
No, I'm not.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.310
I'm not.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:11.900
But...

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.140
But you could say I once was.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.550
"Once was"?

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.880
What does that mean?

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.230
Miao Jie said

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.660
I would eventually take over

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:22.060
Yesha's mission one day.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.380
So he kept forcing me

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:25.910
to learn various methods

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.310
of killing and committing crimes.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.180
But I never wanted revenge,

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.640
nor did I want to get myself killed.

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.550
I just want to live my life.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:35.950
Later,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.380
there was a time

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:39.400
when I caught a cold.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.860
My son has had a high fever for days,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.990
remaining unconscious

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:45.320
and babbling nonsense.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.510
I see.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.470
I'll return and think of another solution.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:51.070
Okay.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.470
This way, please.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.790
I used the lasting high fever

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.580
to pretend I'd become mentally impaired.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:08.100
Could you really fool him
with your tricks?

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:09.450
I had no better option.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:10.550
I was scared too!

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:12.340
Only I know

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.310
how cruel he truly was.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.730
If he had found it out,

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.860
he would have definitely killed me.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.660
But he didn't kill you.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.710
Indeed.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.230
Perhaps

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.820
he was also afraid
of bringing trouble upon himself.

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.750
Or maybe

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.540
he never discovered the truth.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.350
I kept up the act for a while,

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.340
and then he had someone

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:34.070
send me to the Cixin Orphanage.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.070
Later, I seized a chance

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:38.340
to escape from there.

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.240
You already made your escape,

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.400
so why didn't you run farther away?

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:44.030
Staying in the capital,

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.550
weren't you afraid he'd find you?

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:47.150
If he wanted, he could find me

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.660
even if I fled to the ends

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.790
of the world.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:51.860
Only by hiding in the capital

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.180
could I diminish his threat.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.620
Yet three years ago,

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.620
I heard that he died at Fengbo Lake.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:01.780
I also heard

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.340
that Xiao Beiming was Yesha

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.380
and was on the run.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:05.370
I don't know

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.890
what exactly happened.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:07.920
I was afraid you were

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.610
in cahoots with him

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:09.940
and would come after me.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.420
Back then,
constables from both units in the capital

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.750
were all hunting for me.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.860
You still felt the capital was safe,

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.180
so you simply disguised yourself
as a beggar

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.240
and have been hiding here ever since.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.900
How clever.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.040
Now I've told you

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.290
everything I know.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.230
I can testify for you

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.840
that Miao Jie was Yesha.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.080
I can testify for you.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.050
I'm really not

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.470
the person you're looking for.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:34.320
I swear I have

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.870
nothing to do with all this!

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.180
Take him back and lock him up for now.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:41.990
Let's go.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.070
Judging from his reaction,

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.470
he was probably not lying.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.550
He truly doesn't have
Yesha's capabilities.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:04.210
His confession and that secret chamber

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.170
can both prove

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.820
that Miao Jie was Yesha.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.300
Using this evidence,

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.139
could we

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:11.400
acquit you and Chief Fang of the charges?

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.550
It's not enough.

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:14.389
Before we find the new Yesha,

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.300
all deductions remain speculation.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.100
Putting aside whether

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.429
Chief Fang and I can be exonerated,

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:20.179
revealing those things about Haiya

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:22.710
can only make the situation
more precarious.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:29.730
But we're running out of time.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:31.550
I can persuade His Majesty

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.659
to postpone the execution,

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:33.219
but if

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:35.070
there's no new evidence or leads,

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.659
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.590
still can't escape this disaster.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:42.580
Chief Zhuge,

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:43.380

related to the Yesha case?

What are you planning to do?

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:48.739
I need to think

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:49.739
and clear my mind.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.620
I feel like

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.550
I've missed something important.
