00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.640
You've come

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.100
for revenge, haven't you?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.400
I'm not afraid of you!

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.510
Come on!

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.590
-Master! Master!
-Take revenge on me!

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.190
-Master, what's wrong?
-Revenge!

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.710
Come on!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.620

[Episode 8]

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.960
You want me to go find him

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.190
and investigate the case with him?

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.630
Do you remember which year I told you

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.840
about the incident in Haiya?

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.280
The 36th year of Ningtai.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.520
Miao Jie once said

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.400
that Master was terrified of people

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.800
finding out about what happened back then.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.560
If that incident refers to

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.020
the destruction of Haiya,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.260
then that year should be

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.660
the 36th year of Ningtai.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.590
Since Miao Jie mentioned this matter,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.360
it means he's also privy to it.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.079
So we need to check

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.870
Master's and Miao Jie's resume documents

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.870
to see where they were

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.910
and what they did

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.910
in that year,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.430
which might give us some leads.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.280
But all officials' resume documents

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.400
are kept in the Imperial Secretariat,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.280
and the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.470
doesn't have major case authority now.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.710
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.960
we can't enter the Imperial Secretariat

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.560
and access those documents.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.250
So that's why you want me

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.650
to go find Zhuge Kongyun?

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.590
But he's naturally suspicious.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.720
Why would he help me?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.470
When fishing, you need bait, of course.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.800
Young Master,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.800
did you stay up all night?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.470
I've gone through

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.680
these four officials' documents

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.840
several times already,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.970
but I really can't see anything wrong.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.040
All I can tell is that they have

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.240
served the country and the people

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.310
with utmost dedication.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.190
I really don't understand

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.360
why Xiao Beiming would target

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.650
these four officials.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.550
Young Master,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.510
are we on the wrong track?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.190
No,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.120
we're on the right track.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.200
Have you found something

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.070
in these documents?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.159
The Council Chamber?

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.120
The problem lies in the Council Chamber.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.560
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.659
the late emperor passed away

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:57.920
and His Majesty ascended the throne.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.480
The late emperor was gravely ill then,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.630
too weak to attend court,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.120
so several officials

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.430
from various ministries
were temporarily assigned

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.120
to help him handle state affairs.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.180
The side hall

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.240
where these officials were stationed

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.510
was called the Council Chamber.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.040
The 36th year of Ningtai...

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.950
This year is the 22nd year of Xingwen.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.000
Even if the four officials

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.600
worked together in the Council Chamber,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.060
that was over 20 years ago.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.560
Could Xiao Beiming really kill them

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.800
just because of that?

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.310
Xiao Beiming was too young

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.720
to remember anything back then.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.160
Besides the tombstone statue,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.540
this is the only connection

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.360
we've found between these four officials.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.190
The Council Chamber

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.920
isn't a motive for the killing.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.110
So I'm wondering

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.760
if these four officials

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.430
did anything together at that time

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.870
and caused any trouble.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.510
But there's nothing recorded

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.860
in these documents.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.270
Precisely.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.930
And that makes it more suspicious.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.270
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.190
what exactly happened?

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:53.750
Young Master,

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.750
someone is asking to see you.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.510
Who is it?

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.000
It's Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.070
Since childhood,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.820
you've never approached me

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.150
on your own initiative.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.530
Is there something important

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.580
for you to come here this time?

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.050
Haven't you always wanted

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.000
to work with me?

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.970
You've changed your mind?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.170
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.720
Is Mr. Shen dead?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.890
You're well-informed.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.390
I'm not surprised.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.940
Seven officials were killed 3 years ago,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.230
and one of them was my father.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.570
Recently in the corpse-sewing case,

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.340
seven more people died.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.470
Including Mr. Shen,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.680
a total of 15 people

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.360
were brutally killed by Yesha.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.800
Compared to these lives,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.480
the feud between our two units

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.680
means nothing.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.920
If we can catch Yesha sooner,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.800
everyone

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:57.820
will be relieved much sooner.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.270
I do hate Yesha,

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.570
but I can still tell right from wrong.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.890
It's admirable

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.920
that you can think that way.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.870
So you agree?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.070
Mr. Shen died tragically.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.400
His Majesty was furious

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.090
and ordered the Secret Investigation Unit

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.090
to solve this case

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.870
and arrest Yesha within a month.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.270
Having your help at this time

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.750
is exactly what I need.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.480
But now

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.160
all the clues have been cut off,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.560
and I'm completely lost.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.360
I actually have a clue.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.920
I'm all ears.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.159
I can tell you,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.790
but you need to promise me

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.070
that I can investigate the case with you.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.270
That depends on whether this clue

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.200
is useful or not.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.800
If it's useless...

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.800
Zhuge Kongyun,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.680
if it weren't for wanting

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.840
to catch Yesha quickly,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.120
I would never have come to see you.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.040
I've already broken

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.270
the Elite Constabulary Unit's rules,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.070
yet you're still playing games with me.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.430
Since you don't trust me,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.630
let's part ways here.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.950
Wait!

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.890
You're so quick-tempered.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.750
What is needed for investigating a case?

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.040
Calmness.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.040
Look at you!

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.930
Can you just...

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:24.360
Fine.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.310
I promise you.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.460
But I also have one condition.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.430
Speak.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.390
If I capture Yesha, Xiao Beiming,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.840
you can't take justice
into your own hands.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.909
He must be handed over to my unit,

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:39.360
agreed?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.000
Agreed.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.480
If your mind isn't calm,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.750
you won't win.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.390
Is it because of

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.910
Mr. Shen Bi?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.610
Mr. Shen died because of me,

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.550
yet I have no clues.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So you made a risky move

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.720
by sending Xueman to find Zhuge Kongyun.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.480
Attack can be a form of defense,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.200
and defense can be a strategy for attack.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.360
This is a risky move,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.240
but also a vital one.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.600
But Zhuge Kongyun

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.870
won't be content just to be a mere pawn.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.390
If there's even the slightest oversight,

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.080
he'll jump off the chessboard.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.140
When that happens,

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.060
you won't be able to control the situation.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.410
Make your move.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.150
Master.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.130
Do those orphans from Haiya

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.390
have anything to do with you?

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.380
You said Xiao Beiming had a big fight

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.720
with King Zhong of Constables

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.320
before the Fengbo Lake case?

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:14.590
That's right.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.100
They argued fiercely.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.500
But I didn't hear

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.150
the specific details of their argument.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.960
I only vaguely heard a few words.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.440
What words?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.120
The 36th year of Ningtai.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.370
What does that mean?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.320
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.960
I wasn't even born then.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.420
I don't know what it means,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.600
but the fact that they mentioned

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:36.650
this year during their argument

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.850
must be significant.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.960
I'm wondering

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.550
what exactly happened that year.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.130
Could it be related to Yesha

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.250
killing my father?

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.200
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.750
where did King Zhong of Constables work?

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.030
My father once mentioned he was a soldier

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.150
before joining
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.790
But I don't know

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.080
which army he served in

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.000
specifically.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.650
That's why I came to you,

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.950
hoping to check my father's documents.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.510
My Lords,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.630
is there anything

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.790
I can help you with?

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:48.100
How could these documents

be tampered with?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.120
Well...

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.000
My Lords,
please be careful with your words.

Don't make accusations like that easily.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.840
See for yourself.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.150
The documents of King Zhong of Constables

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.720
from the 36th year of Ningtai and earlier

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.920
have all been torn up.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.630
This...

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.950
I really don't know

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:05.930
what happened.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.700
For officials of his rank,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.840
their documents

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:09.150
must be personally reviewed

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.630
by His Majesty and the cabinet

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.550
every year

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.360
before they can be filed and sealed.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.870
Not to mention tearing them up,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.440
even to review them,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.790
you need to have a review order.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.320
So what's going on here?

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.720
Unless

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.140
they had been torn up before being filed.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.140
How dare you!

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.370
I wouldn't dare.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.610
Forgive me, My Lord.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:30.510
Leave.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.150
Yes.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.450
Is he suggesting...

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.700
Could it be that His Majesty...

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.690
So what should we do now?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.120
Although his documents

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.080
were torn up,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.150
after the 36th year of Ningtai,

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.320
he was indeed transferred
from the Ministry of War

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.790
to the Ministry of Justice.

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.440
We can check

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.910
the documents of the Ministry of War.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.840
Since the King of Constables
once served in the military,

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.840
there must be comrades we can trace.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.390
Let's see

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:01.360
who used to work with him

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.960
in the 36th year of Ningtai.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.670
Boss.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.120
We've been waiting so long,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.720
yet Constable Zhong hasn't come back.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.850
Could something have happened to her?

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.860
That woman

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.770
could handle ten sly foxes

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.300
without getting a scratch.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.440
You think Zhuge Kongyun

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.320
is just like you,

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.250
only knowing how to fight and kill?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.490
Then what else is there to be afraid of?

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:03.960
Boss.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.390
I just bought some sweet tofu

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.520
and it's still warm.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.890
I'm not hungry. Give it to Feng Qingzhuo.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.850
Isn't it hot?

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.200
No.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.240
It's not hot.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.930
How's my speed
at investigating these dossiers

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.930
compared to Xiao Beiming back then?

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.630
Let's get to the point.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.030
Have you found anything?

[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Miao Jie, Huo Zongyao]

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.640
Miao Jie?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.870
Huo Zongyao?

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.080
Like King Zhong of Constables,

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.130
their documents
from the 36th year of Ningtai

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.910
and before

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.220
have also been torn up.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.270
It seems

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.400
someone

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.120
doesn't want us to discover

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.080
what happened back then.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.080
Mr. Miao was killed
at Fengbo Lake 3 years ago

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.510
along with your father.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.390
Now only General Huo is still alive.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.510
He retired
from the Ministry of War last year

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.150
and is now living in retirement at home.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.550
Let's go find him.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.990
Constable Zhong, I remember 3 years ago

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.670
when you married Xiao Beiming,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.330
General Huo was also present.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.600
What was his relationship

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.860
with your father like?

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.400
I've met General Huo a few times,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.370
just normal interactions.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.720
Our families had no personal connection,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.120
no gatherings or visits.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.600
I don't know anyone
from the Huo family at all.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.670
That's strange.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.030
General Huo and King Zhong of Constables

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.150
were once comrades in the army.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.010
Logically speaking,

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.720
they should have had a good relationship,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.960
not as distant as

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.790
you remember.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.500
I'm certain I'm not mistaken.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.750
We're almost there.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.750
Let's go find out.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.870
Someone has died.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.150
Could it be General Huo?

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.790
Who are you? Who are you looking for?

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:16.270
Zhuge Kongyun
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.910
I'm here on urgent business
to see General Huo Zongyao.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.200
You've come at a bad time.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.320
My master...

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.650
passed away last night.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.270
General Huo is dead?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.120
That's right.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.120
Another one died?

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.150
What's the cause of death?

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.120
The Huo family said

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.030
that he died suddenly of an old illness.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.360
General Huo
held a high position with great authority.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.450
At a time like this, even Zhuge Kongyun

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.870
can't enter the residence
to ask questions.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.840
We can only wait until after the funeral.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.120
When we investigated Mr. Shen,

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.240
he died.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.480
When we investigated General Huo,

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.720
he also died.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.390
This is definitely not a coincidence.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.090
You suspect

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.630
Yesha's people did this too?

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.510
We need to investigate to find out.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.720
I need to go to the Huo Mansion.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.440
Boss, no!

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.960
You're a wanted criminal now!

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.480
Yes, it's too dangerous.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.030
The Secret Investigation Unit
knows you're still alive.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:56.120
Timing is crucial in investigations.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.840
Many key pieces of evidence
vanish in an instant.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.970
If I had been present

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.870
when Mr. Shen died,

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.970
I could have immediately

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.870
determined his cause of death.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.750
Then the poisoner

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.000
would not have escaped.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.400
General Huo died
in the early hours of last night.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.440
There's still time.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.790
But if we really wait
until after the funeral,

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.349
it will be too late.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.790
Xueman.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.210
What happened with Mr. Shen

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.880
cannot happen again.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.640
I understand.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880
I'll see to it.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:28.680
What kind of strange clothes are these?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.480
There are bats and the moon.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.720
Are you afraid that others won't see us?

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.000
You fool.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.960
General Huo's body is lying in state.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.680
Many people will come to

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.000
pay their respects to the deceased.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:37.960
In the Huo Mansion,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.880
they need to light the ever-burning lamps

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.920
and someone
must watch over the flames all night.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.640
Look.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.630
Those people lighting the lamps

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.890
are all wearing these.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.880
This is the attire of night watchman.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.640
Then what do these bats

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640
and the moon mean?

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.240
Bat sounds like "fu",
meaning fortune in Chinese.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.530
Four bats surrounding the moon

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:56.510
resembles a copper coin,
symbolizing prosperity.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:57.510
Since life is gone,

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.310
it is important
to hold onto fortune and prosperity.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:00.750
Those who keep vigil for the deceased,

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.790
apart from family members,

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.270
are often honored guests.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.590
So the servants won't ask many questions.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.830
Well,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.090
you may not be tall,

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.450
but you know quite a lot.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.160
Let's first examine

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.310
General Huo's body.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.030
Be careful.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.590
If we're discovered, I'll cover the rear

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:16.550
while you all escape.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.680
I'm a grown man standing right here...

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.400
And you want to be the hero?

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.200
Enough.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.110
We came together,
and we should leave together.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:24.270
Stay alert

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.240
and act according to circumstances.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.640
Especially you, Tong Shuang,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640
don't be reckless.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.590
Don't worry, Boss.

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:29.590
I will be careful.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.550
Let's go.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:32.070
Did you hear that?

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.030
Stay calm.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.640
Be careful.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.710
Mind and behave yourself!

[Memorial Tablet of General Huo Zongyao]

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.070
[General Huo's eldest disciple
Xue Qianshan]

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.600
[General Huo's second disciple
Li Xiao]

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.620
I've long heard that General Huo

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.110
took in many disciples
and kept them in his mansion.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.000
Today I see it's indeed true.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.110
Those people in the front hall

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.290
are clearly skilled fighters.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.950
We must avoid provoking them.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.070
The Huo Mansion is vast.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.400
The study, bedrooms,

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.200
and places where General Huo

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.390
used to go

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.960
might all contain important clues.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.400
Now the mansion is busy with people,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.230
making it the perfect time to blend in.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.320
Let's split up.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:42.960
Tong Shuang,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.310
you and I will go to
General Huo's quarters.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.920
Xueman,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.150
take Feng Qingzhuo to the backyard.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.770
In an hour,

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.990
we'll meet back here.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.310
Be careful.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.510
You search over there.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.240
What about you?

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.110
I'll go to the disciples' quarters.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.230
I think we should

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.540
stay together.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.890
Are you scared?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.240
Who's scared?

[Excellent in medical skills
and noble in medical ethics]

Please,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.830
don't kill me.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.170
You're not here to keep vigil.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.270
Who are you?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.680
Tell me,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.840
what are you doing in my home?

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.110
Since you're a girl,

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.440
I don't want to hurt you.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.590
Be sensible

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.030
and don't scream.

00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.960
You're a girl too.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.780
As a girl yourself,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.110
why do you have to
make things difficult for another girl?

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:06.710
Judging by your appearance,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.760
I guess you're not here to steal.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.870
This is the training ground,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.640
full of weapons and armor,

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.920
with nothing of value.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.110
Even the stupidest thief

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.710
wouldn't come here to steal.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.000
I found you,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.030
but you didn't kill me or run away,

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.020
which means you haven't finished

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.420
what you wanted to do yet.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.790
Are you here

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.640
in my house

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.210
to investigate something?

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:41.550
Could it be related to

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.310
General Huo's death?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.880
You're wearing
your family's mourning clothes.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.740
Are you a relative of General Huo?

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.270
To be honest,

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.310
my name is Huo Dairong.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.350
I am Huo Zongyao's daughter.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.960
You suspect Huo Zongyao's death

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.050
is connected to Yesha, Xiao Beiming?

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.560
Do you have any evidence?

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.240
Any basis for your theory?

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.400
Intuition.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.670
If we relied on intuition to solve cases,

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.430
what would be the point of laws?

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:15.550
Don't say things like that

Father.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.950
Enough. If there really is
something suspicious

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:19.960
about Huo Zongyao's death,

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.480
the Huo family will report it.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.640
You are too obsessed with Xiao Beiming,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.640
trapped in it without realizing it.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.330
But time is running out.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.400
Any suspicious point

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.110
could be

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.510
the key to finding Yesha.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.470
If we suspect Yesha every time

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.270
there's a murder in the capital,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.680
our Secret Investigation Unit

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.080

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.590
even with superhuman powers.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.160
Being so impatient for results

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.070
will only let Xiao Beiming

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.590
lead you by the nose.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.350
Calm down and think it through.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.640
As General Huo's daughter,

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.960
you're not keeping vigil
at the mourning hall.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.960
Instead, you're here
at the training ground.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:23:59.880
No lamps,

No matter how I look at it, Miss Huo,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.400
you seem to be doing

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.660
something dangerous.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.920
It seems you're not
an ordinary woman either.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.720
That's right.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.240
My father died suddenly,

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.160
with many suspicious circumstances.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.620
I came here to investigate

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:18.310
the cause of my father's death as well.

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.310
Don't be afraid.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.150
As long as you stay quiet,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.310
I won't hurt you.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.200
You're Zhong Xueman.

Although you're wearing this robe,

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.690
the boots on your feet

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.820
are official boots.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:07.030
In the entire Qi Kingdom,

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.440
women who can wear official boots

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.840
are already rare enough,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:12.750
and those with such martial skills

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.920
are even rarer.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.880
If I'm not mistaken,

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:18.080
that weapon in your hand

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.920
is the legendary Bi'an Sword, isn't it?

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.950
-You…
-Don’t think too much.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.920
I've always been

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.250
interested in criminal investigations.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.160
I just know

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.110
a bit more than others, that's all.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.200
I've heard plenty of stories

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.640
about the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.240
Judging by your reaction,

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.680
I must be right.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.450
Since we have the same goal,

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.210
why don't we work together?

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.310
You don't even know my intentions,

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.340
yet you're willing to trust
an outsider like me?

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:47.510
Compared to you,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.480
in this entire house,

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.210
I have no one else to trust.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.240
Besides,

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400
I want to see

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.180
if the famous Zhong Xueman

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.800
is really as good as they say.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.360
If my father had secrets,

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.070
they must be hidden in his bedroom.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.270

I can show you the way.

Have you heard?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.160
General Huo will be buried tomorrow.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.880
Tomorrow?

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.920
That's too fast.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:24.750
Shouldn't the body
lie in state for seven days?

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.400
Yes,

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.080
but I heard

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.920
it was decided by Madam

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.180
and senior disciples.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.270
I see.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.160
Tomorrow?

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.720
That's not right.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.880
Boss, you're right.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.960
There must be something suspicious

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.490
about Huo Zongyao's death.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.440
Where's Xueman?

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.840
Hasn't she returned yet?

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.880
Why did you two split up?

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.880
I...

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.610
I'll go find her.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.270
Help!

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.000
Go!

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.400
Go!

Go!

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.240
Madam, are you hurt?

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:10.560
I was just

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:10.920
[General Huo's wife, Mrs. Huo]

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.880
sorting through Master's belongings

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.810
when this person suddenly broke in

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.250
and tried to assault me.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.270
You brazen thief!

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.880
How dare you break into
the Huo Mansion at night?

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.080
Sorting belongings?

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.510
Then why were you lying on the bed

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.240
with your clothes disheveled?

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.750
You...

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.510
You're a woman!

Boss, I'll go help her.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:33.570
Don't be reckless.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.000
Boss.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.070
We can't just

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.730
leave Constable Zhong there.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.030
You go.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.510
Who are you?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.160
What do you want at the Huo Mansion?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.790
I'm Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.190
I'm here to investigate.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.110
Clever.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.270
Let's go.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:55.790
Let's go.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.830
You claim to be from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.090
What proof do you have?

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.880
Of course.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.310
Just as I thought, an impostor.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.030
Guards!

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.110
Stop!

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.790
There is indeed a female constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

She is the daughter
of King Zhong of Constables,

Zhong Xueman.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.350
Like King Zhong of Constables,

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.350

from the 36th year of Ningtai

have also been torn up.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.370
Someone definitely doesn't want us

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.110
to discover what happened back then.

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.160
Mr. Miao was killed
at Fengbo Lake 3 years ago

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.590
along with your father.

What exactly happened

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.960
in the 36th year of Ningtai?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.160
Li Long.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:50.350

Prepare the horses.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.270
It's late. Where are you going?

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:55.720
Bad news!

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.880
Bad news!

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.110
Speak.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.110
Someone stole

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.240
Master's dead body.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.790
Where are the guards in the mourning hall?

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:03.920
They all came here.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.790
This is bad.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.280
It's a diversion tactic.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.000
They have accomplices.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:09.830
Tie her up.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.480
When I catch your accomplices,

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.720
I'll interrogate you all together.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:13.640
Hurry up

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:14.240
and retrieve Master's body.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.000
Chase them!

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.240
No.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.720
Is this what you call a good plan?

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.000
With Xueman's position
in the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.980

won't harm her.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.470
As long as we have

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.270
Huo Zongyao's body in our possession,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:34.510
we can exchange it for her.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.480
But why do we have to
use the body for the exchange?

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.160
Because this body

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.690
definitely holds secrets.

Yes.

-Yes.
-Yes.

heading toward the morgue.

will definitely recognize me.

What should we do then?

Is there any other way?

Yes, in my box.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.640
Take the lighter

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.810
and just light it up.

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.830
Why is this different from before?

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.750
The poison has run out.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.030
That's just mosquito repellent,

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.550
enough to scare them off.

one last chance

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.710
I am Huo Zongyao's disciple,

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.400
Li Xiao.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.040
This is my senior fellow disciple,

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:47.960
Xue Qianshan.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.440
I am General Huo's widow.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.170
Greetings, Chief Fang.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:34:59.800
Just now

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.670
our family members were a bit rash.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.270
I apologize on their behalf.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.190
However,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.260
Constable Zhong
broke into our residence at night,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.470
and two other accomplices

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.150
took advantage of the chaos

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.760
and stole the general's body.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.960
What we just did

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.620
was truly out of desperation.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.190
With such investigation methods,

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.460
shouldn't the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.260
give our family an explanation?

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:21.230
Constable Zhong.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.630
Is what they're saying true?

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.610
Come here and talk to me.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.850
I told you to come down!

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:38.960
Who's in there?

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.800
Hand over General Huo's body

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:42.640
immediately.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.760
Impossible.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.320
This doesn't make sense.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.900
His tongue is swollen and purple-black,

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.710
with hemorrhaging in the eyes.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.000
These are signs of strangulation.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.630
But the skin on his neck is smooth,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.670
normal in color,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.840
with no ligature marks.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.440
There are no signs

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.710
of any external force.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.590
No injuries anywhere on his body,

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.710
no signs of poisoning,

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:00.510
and his neck bones aren't broken.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.550
How is that possible?

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.360
Impossible.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:06.760
I suspect General Huo's death

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.490
is connected to the Yesha case.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.110
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.310
The reason we brought

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.190
General Huo's body here

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:14.590
is to uncover the truth.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.840
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.760
whenever a military or political official

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.190
of the fifth rank or above

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.400
is killed,

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:23.500
regardless of whether a report is filed,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.880
[Morgue]

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.190
the Ministry of Justice has the authority
to conduct a thorough investigation.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.440
Since General Huo's death

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.630
involves clues to the Yesha case,

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.140
then today

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.630
Constable Zhong's actions are simply

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.190
following the law.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:38.640
That was in the past.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.590
Chief Fang.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.630
Nowadays, all major cases in the capital

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:43.190
fall under the jurisdiction
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:44.320
Even if an investigation is needed,

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.190
it should be conducted by
the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:47.710
What authority
does your Elite Constabulary Unit have?

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:48.590
What did you say?

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.190
What did you say?

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.360
How dare you say that?

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.150
Try saying that again.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.400
If I'm not mistaken,

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.760
I request that the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.480
hand over my master's body

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.030
and charge Zhong Xueman.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.140
Yes, that's right.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.630
Who called for
the Secret Investigation Unit?

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.830
Since only the Secret Investigation Unit
can investigate,

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.830
we might as well comply.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.920
No wonder you are Constable Zhong.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.730
You discovered the suspicious points

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:21.590
in General Huo's case so quickly.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.550
It really surprised and delighted me.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.110
Zhuge Kongyun is here.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.400
If he discovers you,

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:29.840
it

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.710
will cause serious trouble.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:36.850
What do you mean?

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.190
Indeed.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.150
I discovered that General Huo's death

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.000
might be suspicious.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:45.840
But due to the mourning period
at the Huo Mansion,

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.280
I asked Constable Zhong

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.340
to secretly investigate

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.610
General Huo's body.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.160
Causing such a commotion

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.890
was due to my poor planning.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.960
I

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.990
apologize to everyone from the Huo family.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.440
The Secret Investigation Unit

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.500
would actually work with
the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.070
Do I need you to teach me

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.290
how we should be doing things
at our Secret Investigation Unit?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.190
That's right!

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.590
The Secret Investigation Unit

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.400
and the Elite Constabulary Unit
both belong to the Ministry of Justice.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.670
We work closely together on a daily basis.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.480
And now when facing a suspicious case,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.010
we should be
even more united in our response.

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:35.710
Untie her now!

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.440
I think

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:47.280
the autopsy is almost done.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.510
Constable Zhong.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.000
Ask the people inside

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.400
to open the door.

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.400
I'm helping you out of this situation,

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.960
so at least make it easier for me.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.440
If we continue this standoff,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.100
neither of us
will be able to explain ourselves.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:10.920
Constable Zhong,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.960
please.
