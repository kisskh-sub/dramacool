[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.950
[Episode 33]

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.970
He still didn't eat anything.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.840
What is the matter?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.509
He only told us

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.070
not to disturb him

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.730
until Zhuge Kongyun returns.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.400
I don't know what happened.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.000
He's been in there for days.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.430
Shall we go check on him?

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.520
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.960
Is he in there?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.430
Young Master.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.030
Yes.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.960
It is confirmed.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.200
You guessed it right.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.710
[Yesha]

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.590
I remember one thing

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.400
said by King Zhong of Constables.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.430
When all the impossibilities are excluded,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.400
what remains—

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.120
though you may not believe it—

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.910
must be the truth.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.360
He looked like a young man.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.190
Judging from the physique,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.100
that was probably a middle-aged man.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.460
He showed up every time
with his face covered.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.810
[Yesha]

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.120
[Miao Yun] [Miao Jie] [Bei Hai Residence]

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.220
I couldn't see what he really looked like.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.460
[Yesha]

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.560
On the right side of his eye,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.760
there's a black mole.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.610
Beiming,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.400
have you discovered something?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.520
Yesha is Xiao Beiming.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.310
But he's probably dead now.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.510
Master is a divinity.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.910
He never dies.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.630
In fact,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.430
every Haiya survivor

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.310
is Yesha.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.910
Bei Kun and Beiming...

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.730
[Haiya orphans]

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.870
I haven't fulfilled my duty as a father.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.400
Now, I trust my children to your care.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.470
Was the collapse
of Bei Hai's underground tomb

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.120
planned

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.360
by the second Yesha

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.310
to kill all of us?

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.190
But could anyone

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.150
have followed us,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.400
escaped all mechanisms,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.750
and remained undetected?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.870
How could he have possibly done all that?

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.310
Instead of his ability,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.510
timing was the point.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.520
I've figured out

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.750
who the new Yesha is.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.960
Who exactly?

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.300
The whole story

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.800
started after the Haiya Case.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.120
As we previously deduced,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.030
the Canfeng Army committed

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.150
severe crimes in Haiya.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.400
Miao Jie returned to
the Imperial Secretariat

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.680
with bitter enmity,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.430
planning to avenge Haiya people.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.820
Being well aware that he couldn't

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.420
complete the revenge alone,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.160
he began grooming a successor.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.400
But the one he chose pretended to be

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.750
mentally challenged.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.520
Right.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.930
I bet he considered

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.190
[Miao Yun]

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.360
killing Miao Yun.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.960
But he couldn't bring himself to do it,

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.760
since they were both from Haiya.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.000
So, he made a risky decision

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.400
of sending Miao Yun away,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.610
leaving him to fend for himself.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.920
[Miao Yun]

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.430
And then?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.810
Then, he started

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.000
training a new successor.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.630
That was the very beginning of

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.130
the deaths of the Canfeng Army members

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.390
recorded in the Haiya orphan registry.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.600
Those Haiya orphans were

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.040
taken away one after another.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.310
He meant to select one of the orphans

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.240
to be the new Yesha?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.840
I guess I was a candidate too.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.920
But Master's protection

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.040
for me

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.870
denied him any chance to make a move.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.040
However, eventually,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.870
he still found an ideal successor.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.470
That child was just like him,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.000
as they both harbored deadly hatred.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.240
The child was brutal, heartless,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.840
and extremely intelligent.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.800
Then, they started

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.400
planning for the first case.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.270
That very case led to

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.560
all the events we knew of later.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.070
Which case was it?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.130
Pingyuan Escort Agency...

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.390
One thing has been bewildering me.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.390
As part of his revenge,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.000
Miao Jie killed many of
the Canfeng Army members
involved in the slaughter

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.830
and the officials
who suggested this ruthless act.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.040
But he only killed the people of interest

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.480
and spared their families.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.480
There is only one explanation for it—

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.410
he had to conceal the real identity

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.770
of the child he chose.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.800
Dead people

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.500
can't be suspects.

[Tong Xin] [Male Infant]
[Tong Peng]

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.800
The child he picked

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.070
was Tong Shuang.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.830
How could that be possible?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.630
You're saying Tong Shuang is...

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.750
I've been wondering about one thing.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.360
How did the new Yesha get to know

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.480
each move of our plan,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.220
including the time

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.430
we set off for Haiya?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.580
That secret complaint letter of misconduct

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.120
against Chief Fang was delivered

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.600
to the Secret Investigation Unit

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.130
precisely
before we returned to the capital.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.750
There could only be one reason—

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.240
that person has been around us
the entire time.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.040
Impossible.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.830
Absolutely impossible.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.360
I know

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.940
you find it unbelievable.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.600
But during my visit to Weizhou...

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.210
The second young master Tong Peng

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.430
was brought back by Master.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.430
[Pingyuan Escort Agency]

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.750
Nobody knows who his mother is.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.430
The third young master was about

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.830
the second one's age at that time.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.950
He was a naughty,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.160
energetic and active

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.800
little troublemaker.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.750
He especially liked to
provoke the second young master.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.310
What a delight to see him

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.160
become a composed

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.240
and calm gentleman now.

Mr. Hai,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.720
can you take me

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.290
to the Tong family cemetery?

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.400
[Pingyuan Escort Agency]
[Tomb of Tong Peng]

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.430
Look at this...

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.240
How do we explain it to Master?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.120
I remember these two brothers

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.320
once got into a fight.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.600
The second young master

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.680
pushed the third young master
to the ground.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.800
The third young master's right arm broke.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.870
His right arm bone

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.560
is noticeably thinner than the left one,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.070
which means his right arm

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.390
was injured before he died.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.190
Children's bones grow quickly.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.000
This kid's injured right arm

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.240
wasn't able to move for a long time.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.360
His right arm bone

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:04.800
became

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.310
like this after it healed.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.270
Mr. Hai,

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.000
if your memory

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.510
serves you right about that fight,

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:10.570
then I can conclude

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.560
that the boy in this coffin
is not Tong Peng,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.750
but Tong Shuang,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.870
the injured third young master.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.950
Tong Shuang...

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.750
is an impostor?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.750
Do you remember

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.870
Mr. Shen Bi?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.480
I followed the Secret Investigation Unit

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.510
to Chunyu Town.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.480
Mr. Shen was found

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.240
in a place

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.390
with lots of children.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.790
Then, they took Mr. Shen

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.050
to a house,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.240
which was surrounded by mountains.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.360
If my guess is right,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.190
the person
who poisoned and killed Mr. Shen

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.120
was the man who was with him

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.560
the whole time—Tong Shuang.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.600
Do you remember who was with Qing Ying

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.630
when she died?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.920
What exactly happened

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.000
in Haiya back then?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.270
Do you think I'm a spineless coward

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:46.480
like Zhu Yitie?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.190
I won't say anything.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.680
Do you remember who was the last person

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.540
Huang Wuchang met before he died?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.800
Attack!

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.410
Could those be coincidences?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.370
These incidents aren't enough to prove

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:31.970
that their deaths

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.720
were orchestrated by Tong Shuang.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.630
What Beiming said

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.690
is probably right.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.000
When I untied Tong Shuang,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.630
I noticed the rope marks were very light.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.960
I didn't give it too much thought.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.080
But now that I think about it,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.270
if he had been tied during the long time

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.600
he was held as hostage,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.750
the marks would've been deep,

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.320
and there might have been bruises.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.840
But the situation was the opposite.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.910
Are you suggesting

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.880
that he didn't tie himself up

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.090
until he realized

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.840
we were about to reach the peak?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.170
Besides, Huang Wuchang

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.700
committed suicide without hesitation.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.960
If I'm not mistaken,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.240
they must have discovered

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.440
Bei Hai's underground tomb

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.370
and even entered it more than once.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.200
Given their capability,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.080
it wouldn't be difficult for them

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.600
to solve

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.720
the three riddles there.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.440
But since they didn't have the key,

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.310
they failed to access

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.370
the inner chamber.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.960
So, he approached you

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.510
in order to find the key.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.030
Miao Jie knew

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.290
Master was the person

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.150
who Bei Hai last met.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.060
If that key

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.230
truly exists,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.400
Bei Hai must've

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.690
given it to Master.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.720
After Master died,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.820
they couldn't find this key

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.670
even after searching
the entire Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.000
If I were Yesha,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.150
I would also assume

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.170
Master gave me the key

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:29.960
in the end.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.970
So, the explosion
in the underground tomb that day

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.600
was triggered by his people

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.400
who he planted there in advance.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.330
He already got

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.530
what he wanted.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.450
Faking his own death

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.810
under the fallen rocks

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.790
was his final escape plan.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.390
After all, none of us

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.980
have really seen his body.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.910
What he wanted to get...

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.550
It was the Swift Wind Pills.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.040
He made us go to Haiya

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.210
because he believed

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.510
there were Swift Wind Pills left

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.200
in that secret chamber.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.910
This is bad.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.540
Now, he has the formula

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.770
of the Swift Wind Pills.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:04.370
What he wants

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.490
more than anything now is...

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.950
To take the final revenge.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.510
[Zhu Yitie] [Huang Wuchang]
[Swift Wind Pills]

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.410
I disagree.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.260
This is essentially a gamble.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.930
Once we start doing this,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.050
there will be

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.050
no returning.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.510
Do we have another choice?

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:21.490
We have no choice.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.770
We have to take this gamble.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.080
What's the urgent matter
that brings you here?

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.880
Your Majesty,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.770
the Secret Investigation Unit has found

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.370
trails of Xiao Beiming.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.320
Where is he?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.490
He is not in custody.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.050
Instead, he is waiting outside the hall.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.920
Outside?

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:43.810
Your Majesty,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.370
the Secret Investigation Unit

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.800
has obtained new evidence

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.650
on the case regarding Yesha.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.490
Now, it is confirmed

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.290
that Xiao Beiming is not Yesha,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.680
and that the crimes he is accused of

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.490
are false accusations.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.920
What do you mean?

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.250
Your Majesty,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.680
since the Fengbo Lake case,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.320
Xiao Beiming has been wronged

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.650
and on the run for three years,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.490
adamantly looking for evidence

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.490
to clear his name.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.130
Chief Fang

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.840
believed the proof he presented,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.650
so he risked his life

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.770
to release Xiao

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.050
in order to verify the truth.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.170
Since the truth has been revealed now,

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.600
Xiao Beiming is
voluntarily surrendering himself.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.200
The truth has been revealed?

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.650
What exactly is it?

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.410
Xiao Beiming's findings

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.650
are inconceivable,

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.770
astounding,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.440
and far beyond my imagination.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.680
The Yesha case has wide implications.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.600
It is even related to

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.170
the safety of the Qi Kingdom.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.050
We couldn't come up with
a final resolution.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.250
After deliberation,

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:36.080
we decided to bring Xiao Beiming here

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.300
to meet Your Majesty.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.730
We long for an imperial edict
from Your Majesty

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.390
after hearing his statement.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.920
Do you two believe

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.410
Xiao Beiming?

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:53.920
Bring him in.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.980
Yes.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.070
This humble commoner Xiao Beiming
pays respects to Your Majesty.

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.880
Rise.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.480
Thank Your Majesty.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.050
Remove his shackles.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:48.170
I'm afraid it's inappropriate,
Your Majesty.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.200
How is it inappropriate?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.440
Both the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.950
are working to clear this man's name now.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.840
I'd trust these two divisions

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.340
of the Ministry of Justice,

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.340
even if I don't believe Xiao Beiming,
don't you think?

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.730
Thank Your Majesty.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.050
Long time no see, Xiao Beiming.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.410
You look haggard now,

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.600
unlike what you used to be—

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.080
a spirited young man.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.600
I haven't been faired well.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.400
I feel so blessed to have a chance

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.940
to speak for myself before Your Majesty.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.410
They all say you were wronged.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.530
How exactly were you treated unjustly?

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.290
How is Yesha related to

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.800
the safety of the Qi Kingdom?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.880
Your Majesty,

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.460
do you know about Haiya?

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.390
You seem to have known it all along.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.650
Eunuch Wang.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.290
Yes.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.500
All of you,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.320
leave now.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.200
Yes.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.530
How did you get to know about

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.200
that place?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.660
Not only do I have knowledge of it,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.010
I've also been there myself

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.720
in quest of the truth.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.200
I already learned

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.060
what happened 20 years ago,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.530
namely the history
that the Qi Kingdom tries to cover up.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.610
How could you possibly have been there?

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.560
Haiya was already...

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.320
Burned and concealed.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.380
Even erased by the Qi Kingdom, right?

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.230
It didn't cease to be.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.250
On top of that,
the history buried by the Qi Kingdom

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.320
gave birth to

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.410
the heinous Yesha.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.560
Everything Yesha has done

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.810
serves the purpose of avenging Haiya.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.140
[Rende Gate]

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.630
Whether we live or die,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.090
it all depends on him.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.460
Life, death and wealth

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.840
are all decreed by fate.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.770
Beiming has never let anyone down.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.780
The pill disaster?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.400
Your Majesty,

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:24.960
the new Yesha has obtained

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.800
the formula of the Swift Wind Pills now.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.680
That is to say,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.130
the mass casualty event
caused by pill toxins

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.370
20 years ago

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.430
will happen again.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.780
Only this time,

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.770
the disaster will befall

How many people does Yesha

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.200

Even if they all show up,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.240

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.540
What if the Swift Wind Pills

aren't prepared for Yesha's followers?

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.130

Today, I'm not here

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:00.430
Then what are you here for?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.660
Has Your Majesty thought about this?

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.839
Even if we catch the new Yesha,

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.790
won't there be a third Yesha

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.960
or a fourth Yesha?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.010
Yesha is

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.010
only a name.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.970
Their acts are driven

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.319

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800
A tiger!

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:52.400
What's going on?

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.730
Mr. Wu!

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:02.840
Mr. Wu!

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.480
-His uniform...
-Mr. Wu!

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.970
All four symbols turned demonic.

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:08.600
The White Tiger...

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.560
The White Tiger killed a man!

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.770
The White Tiger killed a man!

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.360
The White Tiger killed a man!

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.880
A man died! A man died!

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.050
Secure the area!

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:51.970
What did you find?

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.080
All his bones are fractured,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.340
and organs displaced.

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.750
He must've died in a fall from height.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.880
But these lacerations and puncture wounds

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.560
appeared before his death.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.330
What caused these injuries?

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:04.690
Beasts.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.290
Fierce beasts

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.360
with sharp claws and fangs.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.800
Animals like tigers and leopards

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.290
with sharp teeth and claws

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.530
could cause these injuries
by biting and mauling.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:14.160
Did you really

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.560
see a tiger in the clouds?

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.090
Not just us,

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.860
everyone saw it.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.050
A tiger flew into the sky to kill a man...

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:22.400
How could that be possible?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.530
I'm puzzled too.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.490
Were those dancing in the street

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.950
from your theater troupe?

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:37.360
Are you the leader?

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:38.970
Yes, I am.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.550
Get up and talk to us.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:43.010
I was just frightened at the sight of you,

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:43.560
officers.

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.560
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.490
Why so afraid?

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:47.640
Officers,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.290
we're just performers.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:50.690
We got paid to perform

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.120
a sacrificial ritual for the Four Symbols.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.800
As for what exactly happened,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.210
we have no idea at all.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:57.530
You'd better be honest.

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:58.840
You're the troupe leader.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.880
How could you not know

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.770
who paid you for this job?

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.010
I really don't know.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.650
A few days ago, when I woke up,

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.840
I found a box at my door,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.120
plus a tael of gold.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.280
There was a letter,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.929
specifying the time and place
for our dance.

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.409
I really don't know

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.639
who planned all that.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.159
You took that job

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.489
without meeting your patron?

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:16.120
Officer,

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:17.929
one tael of gold is no small sum.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.560
It's as much as our earnings
in six months.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.330
Besides,

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:21.679
it was just a dance.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.449
We were not

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:23.810
asked to kill or set fires.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.280
What reason did I have to turn it down?

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.530
We just didn't expect

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.130
those terrible happenings.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.969
Those weird flags

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:31.850
were placed

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:32.760
in the box too.

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:37.889
Sign your statement now.

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:51.199
Look at this flag.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:52.600
What's special about it?

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.450
The pattern

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.410
was painted with dye

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.850
made from Ziyang Grass.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:08.470
How knowledgeable of you.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.010
Ziyang Grass is usually green,

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.010
but it turns red when there's heat.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:14.240
As the dancers

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.840
waved the flags in sunlight,

00:35:15.850 --> 00:35:16.720
the pattern

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.760
would change.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.490
Just hocus-pocus.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:21.810
This must be

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.080
his doing.

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.080
He wouldn't easily give himself away.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.680
There's no use
asking the troupe leader anymore.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.080
It's time to release him.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.370
Is there

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.890
a hallucinogenic drug

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:40.010
that can make a crowd of people

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.490
have the same illusion?

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.410
All sorts of peculiar things

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.810
exist in this vast world.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.890
Some hallucinogens

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:48.590
like the red crystal we know of

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.080
can induce

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.080
hallucinations.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.850
But I haven't heard of any drugs

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.650
that can cause the same illusion

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.080
among a group of people.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:57.200
Right.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.240
The White Tiger killer

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.680
was all a ruse

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.890
just like the flags.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.280
We just haven't figured out

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.450
their connections.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.510
We know it was just deceit,

00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:07.280
but what do the people think?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.560
Now those lines

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.720
and the White Tiger's killing

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.050
have reached every corner of the capital.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.240
Many people

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:13.490
believe that Yesha is sent

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.410
by the divine beings

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:15.850
to save the world.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:16.680
At this rate,

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.160
there will be serious disruption.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.160
I'm afraid this is what he'd like to see.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.120
Killing Mr. Wu

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.240
in broad daylight

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.210
was equal to declaring war on us.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.010
Beiming,

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.810
what's on your mind?

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.410
"Four symbols transform into demons."

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:31.720
"Yesha has descended."

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.160
"The world will be in his reign."

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.560
What's with these lines?

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.890
"Four symbols transform into demons."

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.410
Now, the White Tiger already took a life.

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.410
It means

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.120
three more murders will happen.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.450
Three more?

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.010
This is the tricky part.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.280
Yesha is lurking in the dark.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.850
We know he's in the capital

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:46.720
and what he plans

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.600
to do next,

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.970
but we have no idea

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:50.760
when and where

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:52.050
he'll strike at whom.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.280
Worst case scenario—

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.850
we'll have to wait till a case happens

00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.720
before we conduct an investigation,

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.760
just like today.

00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:57.810
If this continues,

00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.340
we'll have to

00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.530
follow his tracks

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.970
and be strung along.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.050
We're left with no option

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.510
but to find him right away.

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.530
I'll go do it now.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.930
I'll leave no rock unturned in the capital

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:06.930
to find him.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.740
Constable Fang!

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.330
Guys.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.310
S-Shocking...

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.530
Shocking news!

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.540
What happened?

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.200
Hurry back to
the Elite Constabulary Unit now.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.060
Tong Shuang...

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:17.680
No, I mean

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:18.490
Yesha.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.260
