[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.850
[Episode 15]

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.560
Xueman.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.620
Thank you.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.530
Beiming.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.320
Huo Zongyao and my father

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.470
served together.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.590
Was my dad part of the Canfeng Army?

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.790
Three years ago, at Fengbo Lake,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.310
what Miao Jie wanted to reveal

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.160
must have been about

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.820
the Canfeng Army's massacre.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.680
If it's true

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.320
that my father was in the Canfeng Army,

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.829
then he would also be

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.430
Yesha's target for revenge.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520
Then he couldn't possibly be Yesha.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.560
I've never believed

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.820
that Master was Yesha,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.520
and I certainly don't believe

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.910
he would salughter

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.610
the defenseless people

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.610
of Haiya.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.800
There are many suspicious points

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.460
about Canfeng Army and Haiya.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.980
Zhu Yitie said

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.320
he never actually saw

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.380
Yesha's true face,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.080
but on the boat,

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.570
he heard a voice

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.120
that sounded like Yesha's.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.660
Now, Qing Ying claimed

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.940
that Yesha isn't dead.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560
Their testimonies

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.310
have many contradictions.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.310
Are you doubting

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.590
my conclusion that Yesha was on the boat

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.910
at Fengbo Lake that year?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.900
I hope I'm wrong too.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.990
That way, Master

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.720
would be free of any suspicion.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.579
The deeper we investigate this case,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.280
the more it feels like we're entering

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.590
a pitch-black cave.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.230
There's a path ahead,

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.520
but the further we go,
the more dangerous it seems,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.180
and the less certain it feels.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.560
No matter how long the night,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.240
the sun

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.800
will always rise.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.030
According to Qing Ying's confession.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.080
Yesha ordered her

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.360
to first poison Huo Zongyao
through Madam Feng.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.240
Then she switched
Chu Guangsha's immortality pill

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.470
and poisoned him too.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.470
[Upright and Honest]

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.240
Why would Yesha

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.920
target these two men?

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.040
Qing Ying was just following orders.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.899
She didn't know Yesha's motives.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.880
Is that all?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.950
That's all.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.690
Before we could learn more,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.280
Qing Ying took her own life.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.310
Then how did you

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.680
find out about Chu Guangsha?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.620
Why were you present

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.450
at the scene of his sudden death?

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.270
It was because of
the Huo Mansion's account books.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.159
Huo Dairong discovered

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.430
discrepancies in the accounts

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.000
that involved Guangsha Villa,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.530
so I took some people there.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.000
Unexpectedly,

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.890
we witnessed

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.570
Chu Guangsha's sudden death.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.630
At that time, I didn't realize

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.590
that Chu Guangsha's death

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.040
had any connection to Yesha,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.909
so I didn't promptly

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.159
report to the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.159
What exactly was wrong

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.650
with those account books?

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.600
Chu Guangsha once benefited
from Huo Zongyao.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.880
Over the years, he had been

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.430
secretly transferring money
to the Huo Mansion,

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.720
all of which can be proven.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.310
If Chief Zhuge requires it,

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.970
I can submit the evidence.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.050
My main concern is Yesha, Xiao Beiming.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.210
Besides this,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.800
have you discovered any other

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.000
clues about Yesha?

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.480
When we get to
the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.080
what do you plan to tell them?

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.600
I want to tell
the Secret Investigation Unit everything,

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.860
so they can help us too.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.020
No.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.720
You can tell them

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.980
what they should know,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.870
but what they shouldn't know

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.360
must not be revealed.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600
Why not?

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.060
All public records

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.320
of Canfeng Army's actions in Haiya

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.720
have been erased.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.070
In this world,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.800
only one person

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720
can do this.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.760
You mean...

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.530
Massacring an entire city

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.240
is such a heinous crime.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.370
If it wasn't covered up,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.870
it would shake the Qi Kingdom to its core.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.950
His intentions

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.720
are beyond our understanding,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.040
but if the Zhuge father and son
learned of this,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.770
it could cost them their lives.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.060
That's all.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.540
I've told you

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.690
everything I know.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.710
Beiming, food's ready.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.010
Beiming.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.750
Beiming, food's ready.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.120
Beiming!

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.580
Beiming!

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.610
Beiming.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.380
My needle technique is useless

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.120
to him now.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.750
We must find the Fire Cicada,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.600
or Beiming won't survive.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.800
How long can he last?

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.220
Maybe three days.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.630
Maybe five days.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.040
Maybe

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.450
tomorrow...

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.510
Where are you going?

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.440
To find someone.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.250
Feng,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.800
is there anything else

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.000
we can do for Beiming?

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.430
For a city-wide manhunt,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.510
even Chief Fang

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:02.860
needs official documents
from the Ministry of Justice

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.560
to proceed.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.040
This person is extremely important to me.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.480
I must find him as soon as possible.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.310
Yes, I...

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.830
I can help you unofficially,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.310
right?

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.640
The others can help too,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.680
but this kind of thing

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.950
goes against protocol.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.810
If the Ministry of Justice finds out,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.120
the Elite Constabulary Unit
will be in serious trouble.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.950
Jiang Yi,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.090
I'm begging you this time.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.720
I...

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:21.920
I...

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.870
Who is this person?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.780
You don't know.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.270
You don't even know

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.360
what crime he's committed.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.300
Xueman,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.750
I can't help you.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.960
I...

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.960
I'm sorry.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.510
It happened so quickly!

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.740
I swept my leg

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.090
and tripped that thief.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.800
Who knew

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.550
there was another one
hiding behind to ambush me?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.410
That's how I got injured.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.230
Easy, easy.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:04.160
Where did this medicine come from?

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.110
[Fuxing Pharmacy]

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.080
You came indeed.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.960
How did you know I was coming?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.720
I lured you here on purpose.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.710
Otherwise,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.390
would I be stupid enough to sell medicine

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.320
to a constable
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.120
You knew I was looking for you,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.850
yet you still lured me here.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.820
Aren't you afraid I'll arrest you?

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.830
Put down what you're holding.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.100
If I were afraid,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.960
I wouldn't have done this.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.990
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.370
I want to make a deal with you.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.510
A deal?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.630
What kind of deal?

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.840
He's dying, isn't he?

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.000
Who's dying?

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.270
You may fool others,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.400
but you can't fool me.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.490
You know who I'm talking about.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.440
No one knows the look of

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.600
someone approaching death
better than I do.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.000
That day at the Ghost Market,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.210
I only glimpsed him from afar,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.330
but I knew his days were numbered.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.380
If I'm not mistaken,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.860
he was likely afflicted by
a type of frost toxin.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.750
The fact that he's survived until now

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.590
is already a miracle.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.320
What else do you know?

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.600
You came to the Ghost Market that day
looking for me

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.550
because you wanted
the Fire Cicada I possess

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.550
to detoxify him.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.120
I'm right, aren't I?

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.390
Since you want to make a deal,

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.120
state your terms.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.120
I remember telling you

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.520
about my rules.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.910
If you want my eyes,

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.820
then take them.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.100
You're such a straightforward girl.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.770
I quite like that about you.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.930
But such a pretty face

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.430
without eyes...

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.050
I'd really hate to see that happen.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.820
What exactly do you want?

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.860
I want the Little White Dragon.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.000
Who is the Little White Dragon?

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.200
It seems that guy

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.180
hasn't told you

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.600
his true identity.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320
Constable Zhong.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.480
How is Beiming doing?

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.660
Beiming is still unconscious.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.030
Constable Zhong.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.360
I know

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.570
you're still worried about Beiming.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.910
You did your best.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.720
If it weren't for my mistake,

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:43.060
Beiming wouldn't be

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.350
in this condition now.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:46.980
After all we've been through together,

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.000
there's no need

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.190
to separate you and me,

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.390
or who's right and who's wrong.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.050
None of that matters anymore.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.630
Constable Zhong.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.490
No matter what it takes,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.360
I will heal Beiming.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.550
Trust me.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.440
Coroner Feng.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.440
There's something I've been

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.500
wanting to ask you.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.120
Go ahead.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:19.420
Do you really not know

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.320
the old man we me

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.740
tat the Ghost Market that day?

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.510
I don't know him.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.080
Why are you suddenly asking?

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:33.750
It's nothing.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.640
It's just that I don't think
I've ever heard you

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.320
talk about your childhood.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.030
I was just a farm boy.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.110
When I was young, I met

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.140
a traveling doctor from the martial world

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.600
who taught me some skills.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.020
There's nothing much to tell.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.100
Poison Valley is
the evilest sect in the world.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.260
They've committed countless crimes

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.220
and are unforgivable.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.910
This so-called Coroner Feng

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:03.040
is actually the Little White Dragon
from Poison Valley.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.070
Poison Valley?

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.800
Little White Dragon?

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.850
How many lives he has taken

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.910
is something only he knows.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.490
That's impossible.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:15.380
Coroner Feng

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.860
isn't that kind of person.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.700
Don't tell me you think

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.760
the personal disciple
of the Poison Valley Chief

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.630
is some kind of saint who wouldn't even

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.890
dare to kill a chicken?

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.050
It's all an act

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.690
to deceive you all.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.470
He is ambitious and killed his master

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.290
to steal Poison Valley's sacred

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.330
Yin-Yang Book.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.510
I'm looking for him

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.030
to avenge my senior.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.760
You consider him a friend,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:45.710
but who knows

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.710
what he wants to trade

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.710
your lives for?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.230
I see you still don't believe me.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.550
That's fine.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.550
Just bring him to me

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.480
and I'll confront him face to face.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.930
The truth will come out naturally.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.360
Think about it carefully.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.650
Is the person you want to save
more important

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.770
or someone full of lies

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.790
who might harm you all

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.640
at any moment?

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040
Constable Zhong.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.080
Constable Zhong.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.510
You seem a bit off today.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.590
It's nothing.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.890
Beiming is seriously ill,

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.280
so I'm not in a good mood.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:33.390
I just wanted someone to talk to.

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:34.790
Don't worry.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.610
Even if it costs me my life,
I will save him.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:18.400
Coroner Feng.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.900
Miss Huo?

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.250
Miss Huo, what...

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.400
What are you doing here?

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.240
Qing Ying is dead.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.160
I'm the only one left

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.510
in the vast Huo Mansion.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.400
I really couldn't bear to stay there.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.280
I wanted to chat with

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.710
Beiming and Xueman,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.950
but I couldn't find them.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.710
They've gone to bed.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.540
You've been drinking?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.080
Something's troubling you?

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.610
No... not really.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.000
Let me walk with you.

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:08.270
Medical texts all say
that emotional distress

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.130
can only be relieved

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.290
by following one's feelings.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.950
Coroner Feng.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:16.140
If you trust me,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.349
perhaps

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.150
you could share your troubles with me.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.040
Miss Huo,

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:22.240
what is a friend?

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.619
Why do you ask?

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.520
If you

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.500
deceived your friends,

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:32.650
would they still want to
be your friends?

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.390
Would they blame you?

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.020
Relationships

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.200
are built on trust.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.440
And even more on honesty.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.070
If you deliberately deceive someone,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.330
that's unacceptable.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:47.880
At the very least,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.660
I wouldn't be friends

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.150
with someone full of lies.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:55.050
But there are exceptions.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.150
What exceptions?

00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:59.590
If there's no intention to harm

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.220
or a selfish motive,

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:03.390
what's wrong with a white lie?

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.400
Who has never

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.150
told a few lies in life?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.240
It's like me and Beiming,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.530
and Constable Zhong.

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.960
They once suspected me,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.160
causing me a lot of trouble.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.960
I've also deceived them,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.110
causing them many problems.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.280
Now, everything is over.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.890
The case of my parents

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.390
has been solved.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.440
I actually hope to become

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.500
friends with them.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.250
A gentleman judges by actions,
not intentions.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.480
To understand someone,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.680
look at their everyday words and deeds.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.110
True friends

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.240
don't care about

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.570
what you did in the past.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.090
They only look forward.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:47.960
Really?

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.920
Of course.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.990
Isn't that what you've done?

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.000
Me?

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.390
You're willing to stay by Beiming's side

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.150
and haven't

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.390
feared or avoided him because he is

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.390
Qi Kingdom's most wanted criminal.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.960
Isn't it because,

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:00.960
deep down, you believe

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.240
in his character

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.970
and believe he's not Yesha?

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.110
That's why

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.390
you fight to clear his name

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.720
and worry about his safety.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.110
Why do you still have doubts

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.180
about something
you've already accomplished?

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.750
Judging by your expression,

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.670
have your doubts been resolved?

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.680
Thank you,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.590
Miss Huo.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.700
Is the person you want to save
more important

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.790
or someone full of lies

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.850
who could harm you all

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.670
at any moment?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.520
Think about it carefully.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.200
Have you made up your mind?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.420
As long as it can save his life,

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.080
I'll do whatever you ask.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:59.790
I can give you the person,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.880
but what about the Fire Cicada?

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.680
Hand him to me

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.040
and I'll give you the Fire Cicada.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:06.960
Where is he?

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.040
It's not safe here.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.950
I've locked him up

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:12.310
somewhere in the suburbs.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:13.520
I can take you there,

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.110
but let me be clear.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:17.310
If you try any tricks,

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.270
I will hunt you down
to the ends of the earth.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.200
Lead the way.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.110
He's here.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.950
Where is the Fire Cicada?

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.240
I'll take him with me.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.000
We won't be meeting again.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.240
I'll go find Constable Zhong right away.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.040
Coroner Feng.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.070
Constable Zhong?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.440
Constable Zhong,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.000
I'm sorry.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.350
I've been lying to you all along.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.690
I actually have another identity.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.270
I am Little White Dragon.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.760
I'm sorry.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.040
I'm sorry,

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.720
I've been deceiving you all this time.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.250
I already know everything.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:56.760
Old Bug told me.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.150
You met Old Bug?

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.550
What did he say?

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.210
He said

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.770
you killed your master

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.310
and stole the Yin-Yang Book.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.040
No,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.050
that's impossible.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.920
I couldn't have killed my master.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.160
I didn't steal the Yin-Yang Book.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:13.590
I know!

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.770
I didn't steal the Yin-Yang Book!

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.570
I believe you

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.120
aren't that kind of person.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.760
I've been looking for a chance all day

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.820
to say these words.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.660
You're willing to believe me?

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:29.150
Seeing isn't always believing,

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.920
and hearing is even less reliable.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.630
Exactly.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.040
Old Bug was trying to drive us apart.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.280
But he doesn't know

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.070
what we've been through together.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.350
If you were a bad person,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.050
Beiming and I

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.040
would have died countless times by now.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:40.550
But I...

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:42.240
How could I let his words

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.850
make me...

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.480
But I'm from Poison Valley.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200
Does that matter?

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:54.480
Thank you.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.900
Thank you.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.490
Old Bug approached you

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.110
just to sow discord?

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.760
No.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.470
He wants me to use

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:17.000
Coroner Feng to exchange for
the Fire Cicada.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.900
Don't worry, I won't do that.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.840
I'll think of a solution myself

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.070
for the Fire Cicada.

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.080
Constable Zhong,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.980
use my life for the exchange.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:29.790
Coroner Feng!

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.520
No way.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:31.770
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:32.700
Listen to me.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.010
What I mean is,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.510
I have a plan.

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.550
So this is where you've been
hiding all along?

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.010
Fengbo Lake is over there.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.030
It's the place that changed

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.830
Beiming's fate three years ago.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.870
Not just his, but mine too,

00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:58.720
and that of many others,

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.940
including yours.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.590
Indeed,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.520
no one would think of this place.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.600
Beiming is safe here.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.010
Since you brought me here,

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.080
does that mean

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.690
you completely trust me now?

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.520
Actually, there's another purpose

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.720
in bringing you here.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.870
He's unconscious and can't speak now,

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.400
so I'll speak on his behalf.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.570
About what?

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.390
We misunderstood you before.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.330
We apologize to you.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.520
You little girl,

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.240
going back on your word!

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.860
How dare you be so dishonorable,

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.300
stabbing me in the back!

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.830
Respected elder,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.920
I'm the one who stabbed you in the back.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.790
Please don't misunderstand dear Zhong.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:47.480
She'll hand me over;
you'll hand over the item.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.790
She handed me over,

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:49.850
but you couldn't take me away.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.540
That's your own incompetence.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:51.740
How is that her fault?

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.470
Twisting words, shameless,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.120
cruel-hearted, lowly,

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.200
conspiring together, venomous!

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.040
Enough.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.260
Just keep that little bit

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.790
of vocabulary to yourself.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.140
You already have the Fire Cicada.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.870
What more do you want?

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:08.960
Let's keep matters separate.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.830
The business between us
isn't finished yet.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:11.630
Avenging your Master,

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.360
that old fool?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.880
Do you have what it takes?

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.440
How dare you mention it?

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.040
Your enemy is standing right before you,
yet you can't kill him.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.700
You worthless piece of trash.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.150
I wish I could kill you right now.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.390
But I'm no longer

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:33.550
the Little White Dragon of Poison Valley.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.000
I am Feng Qingzhuo
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.880
We will definitely

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.680
get to the bottom of your crimes,

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.720
take you back
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.600
and make you face justice.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:44.960
We're running out of time.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.320
We need to quickly bring
the Fire Cicada back

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.450
for Beiming to take.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.360
What are you laughing about?

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.250
I'm laughing at your Master,

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.550
that old fool,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.240
for having such poor judgment

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.110
in choosing disciples.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:59.390
You fool.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.050
I'm laughing at you
for sending him to his death,

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.290
instead of saving him.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:05.760
What do you mean?

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.200
Fire Cicadas can indeed

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.000
counteract cold-based toxins.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.920
But using poison to fight poison

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.720
requires the toxins not to conflict.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.960
The Fire Cicada's poison is so potent

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.550
that if he takes it directly,

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.390
the hot and cold toxins
will battle inside him.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.550
Forget about detoxification.

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:23.680
He'll die instantly.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.920
You fool.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.070
How should the Fire Cicada be used then?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.890
You must use special herbs

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.080
to process the Fire Cicada.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.040
Only then will it slowly release

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.030
its warming poison to dispel the cold,

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.870
gradually wearing away the frost toxin.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.240
This is

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:41.450
the correct detoxification method.

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.880
Do you know
how to process the Fire Cicada?

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.020
Coroner Feng?

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:49.010
Do you know how to process it?

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.090
The method of processing Fire Cicadas

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.280
is known only to me in this world.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.560
This idiot

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.750
wouldn't know.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.230
Is what he's saying true?

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.790
He's right.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.520
Old sir,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.040
if you're willing to save Beiming,

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.760
I'll trade my life for his.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.970
But I can't give you Feng Qingzhuo.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:15.170
Take my life and do

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.270
whatever you want with me.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.470
I'm at your disposal.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.280
Xueman, no!

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:20.690
What do you say?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.920
Why would I want your life?

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.930
It's completely useless to me.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.310
Actually, Little White Dragon's life

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.920
is useless to me too.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.860
This whole time,

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.140
I only want...

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.070
the Yin-Yang Book.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.720
If you give me the Yin-Yang Book,

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.930
I can help you

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.360
process the Fire Cicada.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.720
We can't give you the Yin-Yang Book.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.840
Then he can just wait to die.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.140
If you don't teach us

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.280
how to process the Fire Cicada,

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.680
you'll die immediately.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.110
Young lady,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.390
if you kill me,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.590
then

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.960
there will be no one left to save him.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.890
Old Bug was trying to drive us apart.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:21.910
But he doesn't know

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:23.830
what we've been through together.

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.200
If you were a bad person,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:26.180
Beiming and I

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.790
would have died countless times already.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.380
How could I doubt a friend I trust

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.040
because of something he said?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.480
But I'm from Poison Valley.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:35.870
Does that matter?

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.790
[Yin-Yang Book]

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.320
For this method,

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.630
be mindful of the dosage.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.920
Aren't you going to tell them

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.280
about your identity?

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.080
Someone from Poison Valley

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.320
can't possibly be a good person.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.840
Aren't you a good person?

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.960
[Yin-Yang Book]

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.020
I'll give it to you.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.500
[Yin-Yang Book]

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.130
But this is your Master's memento.

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:38.540
[Yin-Yang Book]

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.390
Books are dead objects.

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.650
If I disregard my friend's life

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.790
because of a book,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.280
then I, Feng Qingzhuo,

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.080
am not worthy of being a doctor.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.550
Exchanging a book for my friend's life

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.100
is worth it.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.710
Give me the Yin-Yang Book.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:06.690
I can immediately

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.790
prepare the Fire Cicada for you.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.810
I can do it!

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.730
Give it to me.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.720
G-Give it to me.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.830
Hurry!

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.440
[Yin-Yang Book]

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.170
Give it to me.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.500
What are you doing?

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:19.550
Are you crazy?

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.040
I...

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.110
I know exactly
what kind of person you are.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:34.750
I'll give you half first.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.200
After you successfully detoxify him,

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.950
I'll give you the other half.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.280
Give me that.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.990
Are you dumb?

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.550
Right.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.000
It should be fine.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.000
Although Old Bug
has done many evil things,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.680
he does have skill in making medicine.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.040
I watched him the whole time.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.440
He didn't try any tricks.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.920
Besides this antidote,

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.470
you have no other options.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.200
Why not let him try it?

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.810
Master.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:36.480
Were you in the Canfeng Army?

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.790
Am I an orphan from Haiya?

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:38.550
What exactly happened

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.550
at Fengbo Lake back then?

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.350
Who is Yesha?

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:41.250
Master,

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:42.720
I don't have much time left.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.960
Please speak, Master,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.590
Master!

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:45.680
-Master!
-Actually,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.350
every Haiya survivor is Yesha.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.440
As long as there's one survivor

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.310
still breathing,

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.940
Yesha

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.310
will keep coming back,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.590
-including you, Xiao Beiming.
-Master is a god.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.730
He is the faith and light

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.630
for all Haiya survivors.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.960
He will never die.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.790
He will lead us

00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:59.960
to live on

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.200
until the Qi Kingdom

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.680
pays the price it deserves.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.650
Until we avenge

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.020
all the people of Haiya!

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.200
Beiming.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.810
Beiming.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.590
Beiming.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.110
Beiming, Beiming!

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:20.390
Beiming.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:21.690
Take it easy.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.740
How are you feeling, Beiming?

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.610
I don't feel as cold anymore.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:32.920
Feng,

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.920
you're so smart!

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.020
That's wonderful!

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.110
You developed an antidote?

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.110
It wasn't me.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.630
It was him.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.240
Seems we have quite a connection.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.830
Sir, thank you for your trouble.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:51.080
But you're now involved in

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:51.920
a very important case.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.360
Until the case is solved,

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:56.010
I'm afraid we'll have to
inconvenience you.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.110
You promised

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.200
to let me go after I cured your poison.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.440
Now the poison is gone,

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.920
but you're going back on your word.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.000
You people

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.570
have absolutely no honor.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.870
Forget it.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:09.719
I won't hold it against you.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.550
Speak.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.340
What case is it?

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.710
The Yesha case.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.710
Yesha?

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.590
Aren't you Yesha?

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.210
Everyone in the world

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:20.840
knows

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.790
that you, Xiao Beiming, are Yesha.

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.400
And you have the nerve to ask me?

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.750
What a joke.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:26.679
Sir,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.960
if this is how our conversation will go,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.190
I'm afraid you won't be leaving so easily.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.630
Beiming has already found
plenty of evidence

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.320
connecting you to Yesha.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.780
You'd better come clean

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.980
and tell us everything,

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.540
unless you want to suffer.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.300
Even if you have evidence,

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.360
what can you do to me?

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.350
Turn me over to the authorities?

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.800
Then I'll just keep accusing Xiao Beiming.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.710
Or does anyone here have the guts

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.210
to kill me right now?

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:51.920
We won't kill you.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.840
We have our own methods.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.650
What do you have in mind?

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.800
Old Bug's reputation

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.190
is notorious throughout the martial world.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:07.300
You must know clearly

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.310
how many victims

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.840
and enemies you have.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.400
All we need to do is spread word

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.360
of your whereabouts,

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.000
and within two days,
you'll be dead for sure,

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.920
and it won't be a pretty death.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.190
-You're shameless!
-My master taught me

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.850
to treat people

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:19.750
the way they deserve to be treated.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:20.570
Your master wouldn't think of

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:21.870
such underhanded tactics.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.650
You've learned bad habits from them.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:24.650
Cut the nonsense.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.000
Don't you want the Yin-Yang Book?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.790
As long as you tell us

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:27.590
about Yesha,

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:28.730
I'll not only guarantee

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.960
your temporary safety,

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.440
but I'll also give you

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.520
the other half of the Yin-Yang Book.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.400
Fine,

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.040
I'll tell you,

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.350
but I'll only tell you alone.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:51.230
Alright.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.750
Feng,

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:56.590
being alone with him

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.590
is too dangerous.

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.320
Don't worry.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.840
He can't do anything to me.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.150
But you don't know martial arts.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.520
Isn't he tied up?

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.230
We've searched him thoroughly.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.830
-Don't worry.
-Tong Shuang.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.550
listen to Feng Qingzhuo.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.640
Beiming.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:14.880
Come.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.670
We've prepared plenty of food.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:24.290
These past few days,

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:25.470
we've all been so worried
about your condition

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:26.800
that we haven't eaten properly.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.320
Please sit down and eat something.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.450
Thank you, Miss Huo.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.320
I actually intended

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.320
to visit you again,

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:32.920
but I unexpectedly fell ill.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.100
Constable Zhong

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.530
already told me what you wanted to say.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.230
It's all in the past.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.430
Don't worry about it.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.580
Where's Coroner Feng?

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.360
Old Bug wanted to have
a private chat with him.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.040
This...

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:51.960
Don't worry,

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:53.310
nothing will happen.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.380
I'll go up and check on them again.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.120
Don't worry, it's fine.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:12.970
What you most want to know

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.230
is probably how your Master

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.670
died.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.040
You killed him.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.000
You lost to my master

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.320
in the Valley Chief Competition

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.550
and were poisoned.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.000
My master not only spared your life

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.190
but also saved you.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.070
You repaid kindness with betrayal.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.520
You murdered my master

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:30.070
for that Yin-Yang Book.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:30.520
You think

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.580
I killed him

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.270
for the Yin-Yang Book?

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.440
Isn't that true?

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.590
In Poison Valley,

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.800
it's always been our tradition

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.840
for disciples to test poisons
on each other.

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:40.350
Whoever dies from another's poison

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:41.770
simply lacks skill.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.860
Only you and your master

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.170
are hypocrites pretending to be saints,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.000
learning only antidote methods.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.040
Since your master became Valley Chief,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.150
he banned disciples
from poisoning each other.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.550
If this continued,

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.750
Poison Valley would be filled with

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.840
weaklings like you

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.960
and your master.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:56.850
Then how could Poison Valley

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.040
still strike fear in the martial world?

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.190
My master's kindness

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.920
became your reason to kill him?

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.960
Calling you a fool

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.930
isn't unfair at all.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.960
Cut the nonsense.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.840
Tell me,

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.920
how did you kill him with poison?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.200
The ice-heart grass.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.000
The ice-heart grass?

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.320
Even I can cure
the ice-heart grass's poison!

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.580
How could my Master possibly die from it?

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:20.270
It's ironic.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.900
You're now a coroner,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
but back then,

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:26.230
you couldn't bear to perform

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.070
an autopsy on your own master.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:36.630
You'd been with your master
since you were old enough to remember.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.710
Since you were young,

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.480
I'd poisoned him countless times,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.010
but when did I ever harm him?

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.860
Giving him the ice-heart grass

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.230
was no different
than the usual matches

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.590
we'd always had.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.630
But I never expected

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.160
that he would actually die.

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:49.520
You're lying!

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.670
You never think carefully

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.750
with your brain.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:53.040
If I had possessed the kind of poison

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.360
that could kill him,

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:55.840
how could I have possibly

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.630
lost the Valley Chief position to him?
