00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.359
You’ve really got it tough.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.239
This lousy place, Chicken Girl.

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:09.879
Do you really think

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.840
they’re willingly

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.280
serving you?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.879
I can't stay here another day.

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.560
How dare you all act like this!

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:15.680
Leader Fan,

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.400
Why don’t we go somewhere else

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.799
to talk about divine power?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.920
I can't do this anymore.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.159
Just you wait!

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.719
Shen Wangchen,

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:28.760
wait for me.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.400
What’s the deal with divine power?

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.159
Great, great!

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.560
You’re finally willing to tell me.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.439
Come on, tell me quickly!

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.560
Where did you get your power?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.799
Let me learn from you.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.159
Leader Fan,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.680
You’ve had a bit too much to drink.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.640
You’re not really sober.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.439
Yeah, I’m not really sober.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.920
Don’t rush things.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.400
Let’s talk when you’re sober.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.040
I’m so anxious!

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.400
I’m about to die from anxiety.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.920
Since you want to know about divine power,

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.400
you have to answer a question first.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.199
Is your true form really a tiger?

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:14.439
Leader Fan,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.719
How did this happen?

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.400
I only put it in the grilled fish,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.479
just added truth serum.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:37.000
Momo,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.719
Is there anything I can help you with?

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.280
Can you take this over for me?

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.479
Truth serum.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.080
Isn’t this the chili oil

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.479
I usually use when I cook?

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.639
Tonight’s dishes,

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.919
I put it in all of them.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.159
I’m doomed.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.439
I messed up again.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.759
My cousin definitely won’t want me now.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.400
It’s okay.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.879
If that evil demon doesn’t want you,

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.400
I do.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.759
Why?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.879
Because I like you.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.400
Actually,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:25.800
from the very first time

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.039
I saw you,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.759
I fell in love with you.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.800
Leader Fan,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.159
Leader Fan,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.879
Fan…

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.919
When I was lonely as a child,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.000
I often cried

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.160
to let out my feelings.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.000
I’m crying now.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.519
This truth serum

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.240
even makes you cry?

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.759
Looks like this truth serum

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:25.680
really makes people

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.240
reveal their true feelings.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.759
Everyone has sorrow in their heart.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.040
You used the truth serum

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.360
to let out your feelings.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.839
That’s a good thing.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:50.399
Each time the Samsara Bell rings

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.399
it means a young demon has died.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.360
When I arrived just now,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.720
it had already vanished.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.959
I couldn’t protect it.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:01.279
The last trace of its spirit

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.959
was seen by you.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.920
Another young demon

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.879
was killed by the demon hunter

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.639
sent by your Lord of Moyuan City.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.959
My father would never

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.000
give such an order.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.759
Do you take me for a fool?

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:16.759
Within five hundred miles,

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.160
what demon doesn’t know

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.240
that your Lord of Moyuan City

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:22.439
wants to wipe out our kind?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.399
What’s the point of mocking me?

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.079
But none of you demons

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:28.639
have ever seen the real Lord.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.519
Isn’t that right?

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.680
There are good and bad demons.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.959
Humans are the same.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.600
On this trip, I discovered

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.920
that near Qianchun Mountain,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.079
people keep attacking demons

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.920
without caring who’s innocent or guilty.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.079
Just like demons in Moyuan City

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.040
committing crimes and killing innocents.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.079
But as far as I know,

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.079
what happens in the city has nothing to do with you.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.800
Nothing to do with me.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.279
Demon girl! Monster!

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.639
She killed my husband!

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.600
Monster!

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.480
There’s a demon! A demon!

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.199
Run!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.879
Are you saying

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.120
you trust me?

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.439
I trust you.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.199
For hundreds of years,

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.360
no human has ever

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.199
been willing to listen to us demons.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.399
Whenever they see us,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.319
they either want to kill or destroy us.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.079
That’s why I must become strong.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.079
One day, when my power is limitless,

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.199
I can truly protect my kind.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.319
We won’t be persecuted by humans anymore.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.360
If you’re willing,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.480
you can trust me.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.279
My father would never

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.439
blindly

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.360
order the extermination

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.800
of all demons.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.160
He’s just been searching

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.959
for the real culprit behind the strange murders in the city.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.480
Because the deaths are so strange,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.480
it’s believed they weren’t caused by humans.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.439
So,

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.160
do you really believe it has nothing to do with me?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.439
Of course. I know you.

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:32.959
Those cases

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.720
were all very strange.

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:37.040
I think, Chief Fan,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.959
you’re so righteous and honorable.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.279
If we work together,

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.720
we’ll get twice the results with half the effort.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.240
I also hope that from now on, Chief Fan,

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:50.879
you’ll listen to explanations

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.920
and not act on your own.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.120
Alright.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.000
Then tell me,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.720
why are you looking for the cat demon?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.120
I can’t tell you yet.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.480
You—

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.360
Shen Wangchen.

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.639
My Lord.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.839
We truly know we were wrong.

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.519
Please don’t drive us away, My Lord.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.279
Don’t drive us away, My Lord.

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.560
My Lord, we were wrong.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.600
We were wrong, My Lord.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.879
Please calm down.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:27.959
We know we were wrong, My Lord.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.399
My Lord, we were wrong.

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.360
Yesterday,

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:33.519
who said they wanted to quit?

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.000
Serving the Lord

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.600
is the highest honor.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.679
My loyalty to the Lord

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:46.879
is as clear as day and night.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360
I won't leave.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.080
My Lord,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.120
I really didn't mean it yesterday.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.399
Silence!

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:54.120
You dare show your face to me?

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.399
My Lord,

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:57.080
Please don't kick me out.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.200
All of you,

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.759
go to the forest

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.360
and do ten thousand squat jumps.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.200
Don't come back until you're done.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:08.879
Hurry! Toad Spirit, lead the team!

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:09.559
Yes!

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.639
You two, go as well.

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:12.720
My Lord,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.600
Get out!

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.559
All of you...

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:47.960
You!

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.759
Yesterday, you took

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:51.879
a young demon from my camp.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.840
And you dare show up today?

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.360
It wasn't me.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:57.440
Ridiculous.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.679
You've caused trouble here

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.240
again and again.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.120
Do you really think I won't kill you?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.759
Today, I'll avenge the young demon.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.639
Leader Fan!

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:23.639
Why are you here?

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:25.759
Didn't you promise me

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.080
that if I stayed here,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.279
you wouldn't hurt anyone anymore?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.440
You're here to help him?

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.919
Fine.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.200
Then I'll kill you too!

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.080
Watch out!

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.480
This person is clearly human,

00:10:57.879 --> 00:10:59.200
so why does he have a demon core inside him?
