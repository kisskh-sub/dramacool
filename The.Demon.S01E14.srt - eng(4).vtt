00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.719
Gosh, Chen.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.680
Have you lost your mind?

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:09.159
You know full well

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.400
Princess Huaiyang

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.959
is spoiled and willful.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:15.680
Chen,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.680
we have confirmed

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.599
Dayao's past.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.359
She may be an orphan
from Qianchun Mountain.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.280
But she's pure and kind.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:25.959
We don't look down on her.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.959
Besides, she saved you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.799
and cared for you with all her heart.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040
If you do this,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.079
you'll break her heart.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.719
Young Master,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.239
what's wrong with you?

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.359
Momo ignores me

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.879
because of you.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.359
Father. Mother.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.760
I have made my decision.

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.400
The unrest in Moyuan City

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.840
has drawn the court's attention.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.400
If the Shen family doesn't act soon,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
we may be executed.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.640
Lord Huaiyang is powerful.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.599
By allying with him,

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.760
we can uncover the true culprit

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.760
and restore peace to the city.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.760
What are personal feelings

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.000
compared to the safety

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.040
of the whole city?

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.920
I hope you'll see what truly matters.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.840
Chen,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.480
I understand

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.879
your sense of duty.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.159
But you must know

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.240
that this marriage

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.719
sacrifices

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.039
not only your happiness

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.800
but also...

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.280
Also, Dayao's happiness.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.960
What will become of her?

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.960
I'll make sure she's taken care of.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.599
In times of crisis,

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.800
someone must make sacrifices.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.919
Fan Dayao,

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.280
how dare you bewitch Shen Wangchen!

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.960
Such audacity!

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.520
I now command

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:42.960
that from this moment,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.840
I banish you

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.039
from Moyuan City.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.680
You are never to return.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.240
Who are you to say so?

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.840
What's between me and Shen Wangchen

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.159
is none of your business.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.800
You...

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.879
What are you waiting for?

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.759
Throw this demon girl
out of the Shen Residence!

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.280
Go!

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.919
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.000
I believe

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.120
you would never harm anyone
for no reason.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.560
But promise me

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.199
you won't use magic

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.599
so recklessly again.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:08.759
Trust me.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.400
Even without it,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.680
I can still keep you safe.

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:19.560
Stop this!

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.960
Your Highness,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840
this is still the Shen Residence.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.319
Acting like this,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.199
isn't this far too...

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.240
Isn't this

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.840
making me lose face?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.800
I beg Your Highness, show some mercy.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.759
City Lord Chen.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.759
If you keep interfering,

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:36.599
you're defying the imperial court.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.319
You should consider carefully.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.919
Shen Wangchen,

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.800
I'll give you a chance to explain.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.919
Wangchen,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.400
do you have anything

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.800
to say to her?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.159
No.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.240
Did you hear that?

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:53.719
Then get out of here!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.159
Fan Dayao,

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.080
this is my last warning.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.960
Moyuan City

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.319
is not where you belong.

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.280
Pack your things

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.479
and leave at once.

Miss, choose a hairpin.

This one will look beautiful

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.360
in your hair.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.839
Miss,

don't worry.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.879
I won't tell anyone.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.480
Just pick the one you like.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.360
What a beautiful weapon.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.480
You know me?

You're Young Madam.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.399
and kissed the Young Lord.

Aren't you afraid of me?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.199
A few days ago,

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.839
my husband was sick.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.920
You were the one
who secretly healed him, right?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.879
Your husband was that old toad...

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:16.800
He's that Toad Spirit?

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.920
You're a human?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.000
That old man is a demon?

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.399
Then both of you...

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.199
We're doing just fine.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.439
And I believe

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:28.879
you and the Young Lord will be too.

Young Madam,

just pick

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.839
the hairpin you like.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:34.720
When the Young Lord sees it,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.040
he will like it as well.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.759
Really?

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.639
But

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:39.839
we don't have any money.

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:41.639
It's fine.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.279
It's free.

Keep tracking her.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.160
Why did you call me?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
No, I didn't.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.920
Yes, you did.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.120
I really didn't.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.079
I was calling the waiter.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.839
So you did call me.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.720
Waiter, a pot of Pu'er tea!

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:16.560
Why are you calling me?

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:18.720
Why are you calling me?

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.519
Waiter!

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.319
Stop calling me.

Waiter!

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:42.439
The geomantic compass must be broken.

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.759
Master, the compass is fine.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.720
Could it be

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:57.120
that she has cultivated more
than one demon core?

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.199
Stay here and watch the compass.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.240
I need to pay a visit to an old friend.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.600
Senior Brother,

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.519
I heard that demons
who reach the highest realm

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.000
can have nine lives and nine cores,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.360
like the Cat Demon.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.759
Is it true?

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:27.120
Junior Brother,

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.199
after all these years,

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.080
your obsession hasn't changed.

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:38.879
So you still refuse to help me.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.759
A hundred years ago,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.320
our sect lost countless lives

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.360
killing that Cat Demon.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:45.000
Now that she has resurfaced,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.600
how can you be so indifferent?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.279
Junior Brother,

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:53.759
that demon is not evil.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:56.559
Why must you hunt her down?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.799
Not evil?

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.600
What a joke.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.279
I will never forget

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.240
the pain of losing my parents
to the demon race.

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:09.519
I swore

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.840
I would slaughter every last demon
in this world.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.639
Dayao!

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:23.720
Well?

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.960
Did you find anything to eat?

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.159
Look!

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.080
Look what I've got.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:32.320
Where did you get these?

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.639
I didn't get these.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.960
I brought someone.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.399
Who?

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:36.120
He's over there.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:40.480
What is he doing here?

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.399
Dayao,

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:44.639
he gave us the dried fish.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:45.440
Tonight,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.039
he's even finding us

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:47.799
a place to stay.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.759
Him?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.320
Come with me.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.639
Let's go.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.720
Why are you helping me?

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:20.679
You...

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.279
Does he have some kind

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.960
of speech impediment?

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.600
Dayao, I'm sure you don't know this.

00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:32.840
In the demon realm,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.039
a lot of little demons

00:10:34.039 --> 00:10:36.039
ship you and Master Si Ming as a couple.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.279
How about you consider him?

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:39.039
Nonsense!

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.600
A dignified demon king like me

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:42.720
can't be together with a demon slayer?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.279
We're mortal enemies.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.840
What are you thinking?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.159
All right, then.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.039
Dayao, you must be hungry.

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.480
Let's eat.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:58.360
Yes, let's dig in.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.440
In this world,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.360
being rich or poor doesn't matter.

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:16.679
Where there's dried fish,

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:17.919
that's heaven.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:21.039
I think

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.000
this fish is pretty tasty.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.720
You don't like dried fish, right?

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:33.720
Never mind.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.960
Tomorrow,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.399
I'll buy you some dried fruit.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.120
It's okay, Dayao.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.080
Right now, I really think

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080
it's delicious.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.320
I'll have two more.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.639
See?

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:45.960
(Shen Wangchen was right.)

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.639
(If you care for someone,)

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.000
(you should be honest.)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.320
(Sincerity for sincerity.)

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.960
I'll treat you well from now on.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.799
No. Absolutely not.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:06.639
Dayao, please!

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:08.240
Take me in.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.919
Give me a chance,

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.279
and I'll give you a miracle.

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:14.600
As for the guardian post,
I can't allow that.

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.919
Why not?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.600
What did I do wrong?

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.639
Just tell me.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:22.360
I'll change.

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:23.679
Please.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:25.000
It's only been a few days.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.799
You dare question

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:27.200
my decisions?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.840
Am I still your king or not?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.879
If you keep this up,

00:12:30.039 --> 00:12:31.240
I'll send you back to Qianchun Mountain.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.000
Dayao.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.279
What's gotten into you?

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.039
Again?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.399
Dayao, just take me in.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.919
Tomorrow, I'll have Master Si Ming

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:44.559
bring you more dried fish

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.799
of different flavors.

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:46.519
What do you say?

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.240
Really?

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.159
What flavors?

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:48.840
Tell me now.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.919
Plenty.

00:12:49.919 --> 00:12:52.240
Five-spice, cumin, garlic,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.320
and many more.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:53.919
(Xiao'er.)

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:54.600
Other flavors too?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:55.759
So many?

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:56.799
(I don't wish for you)

00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.200
(to carry some great destiny.)

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.120
(All I want is for you)

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:02.559
(to stay safe)

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:04.200
(and happy.)

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.519
That's it? No others?

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.519
No, no, no.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.399
No.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.279
Absolutely not.
