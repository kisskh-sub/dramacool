00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.010
What on earth are you trying to say?

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.460
I want to work with you.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240
Work with me?

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.630
Over the past three years,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.000
many murders following Yesha's method

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.840
have occurred.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.870
At all the crime scenes,

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.670
his name was left.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.120
Every time a case occurred,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.750
you conducted an investigation.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.910
But in the end?

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.630
They just imitated him

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.150
to frame him.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.030
It's been three years.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.440
Yucheng, Kuizhou,

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.080
East Sea, and West Wastelands.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.510
You've been to so many places

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.790
and solved so many cases,

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.320
but you've still failed to find him.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.960
Am I right?

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.030
Why don't you consider working with me?

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.430
We can find him together.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.030
No need.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.390
In this world,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.960
besides you,

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.440
I want to find him more than anyone else.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.480
Now you have proved

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.000
your ability to investigate a case
and hunt for a murderer.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.550
And we have the same goal.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.790
If we work together

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.960
and share information,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.750
we will find him

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:45.720
in time.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.870
I told you I don't need it.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.130
What else do you want to say?

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.380
I've always wanted to ask you.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.950
You don't think

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.120
Xiao Beiming

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.850
is the murder of the Fengbo Lake case,
right?

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.640
I only believe in evidence.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.310
Fengbo Lake was tightly surrounded
that day.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.480
At the crime scene,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.550
no one else

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.640
could get a chance to get on the boat
to commit murder.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.790
Per the coroner's exam results,

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.750
the people on the boat
were all poisoned by knockout drops.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.470
Then, they were sewn and murdered

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.950
while in a coma.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.930
However, Xiao Beiming

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.480
was the only sober person.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.160
He escaped

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.750
right under the crowd's noses.

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.400
We have solid evidence.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.920
We both know his talent.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960
If he's not Yesha,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.920
why did he run away?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.510
If he is really wronged,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.550
over the past three years,

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.830
why hasn't he shown up

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.030
and proved his innocence?

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.630
That's why I need to find him.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.350
I must uncover the truth

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.550
from back then.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.200
If you really catch him,

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.110
and if he admits it,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.310
what will you do?

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:55.090
I will kill him myself.

[Eastern suburbs, the capital]

Xueman.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720
Long time no see.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.960
Xiao Beiming, you finally showed yourself.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.480
I didn't kill Master.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.460
I gave you

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.810
the clue you got.

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.400
I know

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.860
you would find this place.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.310
For the past three years,

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.480
I've been tracking leads

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.640
on Yesha.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.240
Xueman,

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.550
if you're willing to believe me,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.070
I will prove to you personally that

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.750
what happened on the boat

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.960
at Fengbo Lake three years ago

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.640
Why should I trust you?

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.160
Don't move.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.310
If you move again,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.640
I'll kill you right now.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.250
I'll show you the evidence.

You also found these pinholes

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.270
come from three crime scenes.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:10.170
The victims are three brides.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.240
But they weren't burnt

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.590
but rather

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.200
sewn to death.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.240
These pinholes

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.970
are exactly the same as

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.070
those on the boat at Fengbo Lake
three years ago.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.110
It means

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.070
Yesha has reappeared.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.600
You showed up right when the sewing murder
happened.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.880
Doesn't that just mean

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.960
you are Yesha?

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.270
Master's tunnel

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.160
is a good place to hide.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.110
If you

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.510
don't make it clear,

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.350
this place can be your grave.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:02.920
I spared your life

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.870
because I want

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:04.830
to know what on earth happened

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.230
at Fengbo Lake back then.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.310
My dad treated you like his own son.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.550
Why did you do that?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.000
If you dare to lie,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.730
I'll kill you immediately.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.110
I can only tell you,

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.350
not long after I got on the boat,

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:24.270
I passed out.

As for what happened during the period
when I passed out,

I also know nothing about it.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.110
will be as weak

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.240
as a baby for half a month.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.960
Even someone like me

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.310
can beat him up.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.570
Then I'll take this.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.640
My decoction h-has dried up!

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.440
Take it.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.750
Thank you.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400
Constable Zhong!

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.770
Feel free to come again!

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.350
I've finally got a chance

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.160
to repay her help.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:13.510
My decoction h-has dried up!

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.310
Take it.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.310
Oh no.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.270
Use the medicine
to deprive me of my internal energy

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.920
and prevent me from fleeing away.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.590
And it'll make the interrogation easier.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.590
Cut the crap.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.880
You keep saying you're innocent.

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.160
What?

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.500
Afraid I'll kill you with poison?

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.410
You don't have to go through

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.310
all this trouble if you want to kill me.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.790
I chose to show up today,

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.310
and I never thought of running away.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:56.680
Cut it out.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:58.680
If you are wronged,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.360
why have you been hiding
for three whole years

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.790
until another sewing murder case
occurred in the capital?

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:05.990
You appeared at the scene immediately!

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.070
Because he's disappeared
for three years as well.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.880
Were it not for
another sewing murder case in the capital,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.880
I would have kept lurking in the dark

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.310
and continued to investigate it

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.480
just like the way you looked for me

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.030
before catching him.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.200
I showed up at the crime scene today

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.250
because I was betting my life.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.160
On what?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.750
On a person.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.400
Even if everyone
in the Qi Kingdom believes

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:35.270
I am Yesha,

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.150
there's still one person

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:38.920
who will definitely

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.320
suspect it and get
to the bottom of it for me.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.720
Because no one

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.120
knows me better than her.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:53.680
I met her today

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.750
because I was betting on her suspicion.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.720
If she really thought

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.310
I killed her father,

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.200
when we met today,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.400
her Bi'an Sword

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.910
should have pierced my heart

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.920
instead of my shoulder.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:16.510
I'm not asking you

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.000
to completely forgive me.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:20.030
But I hope you can

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.880
keep this trace of suspicion

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:23.730
and let me stay by your side

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.780
to investigate the case with you.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.720
I promise you

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.780
I won't let him get away with it again.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.960
I will fetch you the truth

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.640
submerged in the Fengbo Lake
three years ago

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.270
with my own hands.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:54.350
Constable Zhong.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:00.830
Constable Zhong.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.920
Constable Zhong.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.550
C-Constable Zhong.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.680
Constable Zhong!

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.720
Coroner Feng, what's wrong?

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.770
Constable Zhong!

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:11.900
The medicine!

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:12.880
I gave you the wrong one!

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.680
Did you take it?

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.080
Did you feed it to others?

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:28.830
What happened?

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.640
It's all my fault.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.310
I gave you the bottle

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.640
without taking a close look.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.920
You didn't take the Paralysis Pill,

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.830
but the Blood-freezing Frost.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:34.920
What is it?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.800
A deadly

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.350
and extremely rare poison.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.440
How could you mix it up

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440
with a deadly poison?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.040
I'm sorry.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.070
But it's not the time to blame me.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:44.590
Let me give him some acupuncture.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.520
Maybe there's a chance to save him.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.700
Constable Zhong,

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.030
I'll give him acupuncture treatment.

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.890
Can you leave us alone for a while?

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.750
Why did he kill my father?

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.160
He killed several officers,

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.960
including your father,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.550
just to stir up rumors

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.920
and spread fear.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.960
The case about the statue's
tears of blood was done in secret.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.720
But the Fengbo Lake case is different.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.750
Don't forget that

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.790
it was my wedding day.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.070
We were surrounded by our men.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.070
Even if he made it,

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.640
he'd have been spotted.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:51.600
My father

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.030
and the others were already in a coma

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.050
because of the knockout drops.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.850
It was as easy as pie to kill them.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.550
Why did he have to

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.550
choose the cruelest sewing murder?

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.270
The sewing murder technique

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.000
is not something
that can be mastered overnight.

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:05.680
I had spent more than ten years with him.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.750
If he really were

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:07.920
a crazy murderer

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.690
who managed to hide it from me,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.620
could he have deceived my dad?

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.400
Even if everyone in the Qi Kingdom

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.790
believes I am Yesha,

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.710
there's still one person

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.590
who will definitely

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.990
suspect it and get
to the bottom of it for me.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160
Constable Zhong!

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.000
How is he now?

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.790
Though I've used acupuncture on him,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:30.310
the frost toxin

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.150
has already infiltrated into his body.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.000
Blood-freezing Frost
is a slow-acting poison.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.080
It will gradually seep

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.810
into his organs and meridians.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.270
You mean there's no way to cure him.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:41.110
Not really.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.690
I've held the poison at bay.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.200
He still has some time

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.830
before the next outbreak.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.550
But as for how many days he can survive—

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:48.720
several months or several years—

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.180
it all depends on himself.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.960
If we can find the antidote,

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.590
maybe

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.200
there's still a chance to save him.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.800
You don't have the antidote?

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.640
This poison is extremely thorny.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.240
All these years,

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.480
I've been working on the antidote.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.110
But

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.790
no progress so far.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:07.960
But don't worry.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.000
The felon has lost all his martial arts

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.200
and internal energy.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640
Constable Zhong,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.310
sorry for getting you into trouble.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.030
Despite his identity as a felon,

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:19.110
I caused you to use the wrong poison.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.350
I will go back with you

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.750
to explain it to the unit.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.680
Be it imprisonment or punishment,

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.070
I won't implicate you.

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:27.300
[Wanted]

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.200
A fugitive?

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.590
He is Yesha, Xiao Beiming?

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.790
He is Yesha?

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.270
Good gracious!

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:43.150
It's okay, Constable Zhong.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.640
Thank God we deprived him

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.700
of his martial arts

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.060
and internal energy!

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.160
Constable Zhong,

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.400
this is a great merit!

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.510
You caught Yesha!

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.030
And I made him...

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.640
Shut up!

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.510
Don't worry.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.160
You won't die for now.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.790
Thanks.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.590
No, no.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.960
I'm still not sure

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.600
if it's a merit or a mistake.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Constable Zhong,

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.970
about the Fengbo Lake case,

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:31.680
I know

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.540
you still have a lot of questions.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:52.790
You said you fainted

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.450
soon after boarding the ship.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.790
But I saw you holding a weapon

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:56.660
in front of my father

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.860
with my own eyes.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.530
How do you explain that?

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.640
I did black out.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.550
And then I woke up

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.880
to the scene where the Master
and the other three

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.400
were all sewn and murdered.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.070
The first thing I did

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.530
was try to save the Master.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.400
But the Master was sewn

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.929
onto the corner of the ship.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.800
When I just pulled

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.330
the steel needle out of him,

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:15.630
you showed up.

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:17.429
I was poisoned back then.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.889
My tongue was numb, and I couldn't speak.

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.670
Then I was shot by an arrow

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.560
and fell off the boat.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.800
The four victims

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.550
were indeed hit with knockout drops,

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.110
leaving them

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:29.570
no strength to fight back.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.760
As for whether you were poisoned,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.360
that's just your statement.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.440
Five people on the ship.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.400
Four died.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:36.199
You can make up a story as you please.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.000
It can't be counted as evidence.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.840
Of course.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.530
If you didn't murder them,

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.920
with the four of them being drugged,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.630
who could sew and kill the others

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:45.480
and himself

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.550
in that state,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.670
letting you survive?

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.420
This is also what confuses me.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.880
As you said,

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.880
there's no way

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.190
the murderer sewn and killed

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.110
the others and himself

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.230
after being drugged.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.630
But what if

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.360
there is another possibility?

00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.110
What if there was

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.670
a sixth man on the ship

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.320
besides the five of us?

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.360
Impossible.

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.370
Fengbo Lake was heavily guarded.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.070
I was watching from upstairs
the whole time.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.230
Anyone who tried to board the ship

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.630
would surely be spotted.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:13.560
What if he was there the whole time?

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.230
I was too cocky three years ago.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.150
I made an inference

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:31.550
that even misled myself.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.190
I thought there was only one Yesha.

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.650
Over the past three years,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.400
I've never stopped deducing.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.280
From the murders of several ministers

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.800
to the Fengbo Lake case,

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:43.450
the victims died in different ways.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:44.230
So,

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.920
I came up with an assumption.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.360
If these people

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.880
were not killed by the same guy,

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.800
then the so-called Yesha

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.190
should be more than one person.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:53.190
Yesha might be

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.520
an evil group scheming for something big.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.670
How can you prove it?

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.590
I understand that

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.280
I can't win your trust

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.360
just with some deductions.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.150
But one thing's for sure.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.880
There are countless killers in this world,

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.150
but a lunatic who's skilled
in killing by sewing

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.610
should be one in a million.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.880
Ordinary people can hardly do that.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.670
Or maybe you

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.760
had been practicing

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.150
this evil technique

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.710
behind everyone's back.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.280
You still have no solid evidence.

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.000
Of course.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.550
Let's not talk about whether

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.610
this evil man is me.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:24.510
He is good at sewing murder,

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.910
so let's call him Tailor.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.920
The recent three
sewing murder cases in the capital

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:29.280
are exactly the same in method

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.140
as the Fengbo Lake case back then.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.630
If they were all done by Tailor,

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:33.670
as long as we catch him,

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:34.880
we'll get the evidence

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.630
to prove that

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.000
I'm not the culprit

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.730
of the Fengbo Lake case.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.400
If you're telling the truth,

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.400
why were

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.670
the bodies in the three cases

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:45.670
all burned?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.590
The burning

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.590
and the victims' blood coagulation

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.880
didn't happen at the same time.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.190
They were sewn and killed first,
and then burned.

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.280
Someone burned their bodies

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.550
to cover up the truth

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.630
deliberately.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.110
If Tailor really exists,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.710
why did he sew and kill them first,
and then burn the bodies?

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.230
Wasn't that unnecessary?

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.050
Tailor didn't burn the bodies.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.280
It was the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.480
Let's go.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.550
I found this

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:24.920
at the crime scene.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.630
You know what this is.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.360
Isn't it
the Elite Constabulary Unit's igniter?

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.470
Sorry.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.110
You two go on.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.030
It's Fang Tianzheng.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.840
Exactly.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.510
Since the Fengbo Lake case,

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:42.480
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.760
has lost His Majesty's favor.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.710
Even the Yesha case has been handed

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.920
over to the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.800
Now the sewing murders occurred again.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.480
I guess

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.710
Fang Tianzheng wants to

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.150
cover it up to avoid

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.710
unnecessary trouble

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.710
by burning the corpses.

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.630
Even if what you said is true,

00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:58.400
as the sewing murders did happen,

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.230
it still can't prove

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.400
the existence of Tailor.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.210
Neither can it prove

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.400
that you're not the so-called
Yesha and Tailor.

The victims

are all weak,

Tailor brought these brides

to such a remote place,

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:27.630
sewn and killed them.

It was meticulously arranged

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:30.810

What is the Four Devils Formation?

When the Qi Kingdom was founded,

there will be the fourth sewing murder.
