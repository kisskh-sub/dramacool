[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.820
[Episode 23]

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.870
[Secret Investigation Unit]

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.900
Xiao Beiming,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.479
I'm somewhat puzzled.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.870
With your intelligence and wit,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.330
as Yesha,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.130
why would you have
revealed yourself for a woman?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.710
Bonds between people

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.350
are something you may never understand

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.150
in your whole life, Chief Zhuge.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.570
All you can do now

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.420
is mock me.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.170
Even if you showed up,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020
it won't help

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.660
with Zhong Xueman's case.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.900
If you can't find proof of her innocence,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.060
even if she isn't executed today,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.690
she'll be executed in autumn.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.130
If she isn't executed in autumn,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.060
she'll be executed come spring.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.720
But what if I do have evidence?

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.100
You found any?

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.620
What makes Zhong Xueman

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.240
the only suspect in this case

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.970
is that she and Old Bug

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.329
were together at the Yaksha Temple,

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.010
and Old Bug was killed soon after.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.060
Since no third person

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.410
was seen entering or leaving the scene,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.570
she was deemed the killer.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.180
Don't tell us

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.810
what we already know.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.010
Tell me whether you've actually

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.970
found evidence of a third person

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.460
entering or leaving the Yaksha Temple.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.380
I haven't.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.060
At least you're honest.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.340
Guards,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.810
take these two to prison.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.690
Yes!

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.860
Father, don't rush.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.060
Let him finish.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.500
Chief Zhuge,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.290
though there was

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.890
no third person at the scene,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.780
the killer wasn't Zhong Xueman.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.800
Nonsense!

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.380
Do you realize what you're saying?

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.250
If not Zhong Xueman,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.940
are you suggesting
Old Bug committed suicide?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.100
There was a killer,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.060
but the killer

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.620
wasn't human.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.290
Not human?

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.970
What, a ghost then?

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.590
It was the heavens.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.940
What?

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.850
Are you saying

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.100
the heavens killed Old Bug?

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.460
It was lightning.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.930
That's right.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.940
It was lightning.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.290
Around the time of his death,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.020
there was a downpour
with thunder and lightning.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.970
What killed Old Bug

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.340
was a lightning strike.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.970
Utter nonsense.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.570
Utter nonsense!

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.530
You don't have to believe me,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.500
but the body doesn't lie.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.500
Have a coroner examine it.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.500
Bring over Old Bug's body.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.290
Yun.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.470
Father, let him do it.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.850
I want to see

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.500
what tricks he's gonna pull.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.620
Bring it over.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.530
Yes.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.100
Chief Zhuge,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.750
I'm no expert in autopsies.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.580
Could Coroner Feng

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.730
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.860
do the examination?

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.580
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.900
Examine it carefully.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.490
We must ensureâ€¦

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.460
fairness and clarity.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.040
Yes, Chief.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.490
There's a crack
running from the top of the skull

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.660
along the cranial suture
to the back of the head.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.490
Swab the nasal cavity,

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.380
and you'll get charred brain fluid.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.550
The iron object the deceased carried

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.220
is magnetized as well.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.370
These signs

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.860
are characteristic of a lightning strike.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.580
The body is so badly charred.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.290
That's also caused
by the lightning strike?

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.930
Yes.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.780
The deceased was a drunkard

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.020
and had drunk
a lot of alcohol before death.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.230
Alcohol is flammable,

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.900
so the body was charred.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.170
It was precisely
because of the severe charring

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.140
that the usual signs we rely on

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.530
to determine death by a lightning strike

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.659
were destroyed.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.580
For example,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.990
skin at the strike point would contract,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.170
muscles would spasm,

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.050
and the chest, back, neck, and nape

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.340
would all show marks

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.700
resembling seal script.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.760
None of them are present on this body.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.290
And that's not all the evidence.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.970
The Yaksha Temple
has been in disrepair for years,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.370
and its roof has leaks.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.580
I found

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.220
that directly above the body

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260
is the largest hole in the roof,

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.490
and the weeds beside it

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.700
all show signs of recent burning.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.700
All this proves

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.110
that Old Bug was killed by lightning.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.410
Take the body away.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.100
Yes.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.490
Chief Zhuge.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.580
If Old Bug was killed by lightning,

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.430
then that should be considered

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.700
an accidental death, right?

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.020
This means

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.490
we now have evidence

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.490
that Zhong Xueman is innocent.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.170
Chief Zhuge,

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.050
can we release her now?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.659
Release Zhong Xueman.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.540
-Yes.
-Great.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.490
Zhong Xueman's case

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.100
is closed here.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.610
But Xiao Beiming,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.460
I still need to look closely

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.170
into your case.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.300
Guards,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:04.820
take him to prison!

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.410
Yes.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.260
No!

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.260
Zhong Xueman!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.260
Constable Zhong!

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.660
While you've cleared yourself of murder,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.930
whether you've been

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.700
harboring a key criminal

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.290
is still unclear.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.970
If you obstruct
the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:25.730
I don't mind

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.490
putting shackles back on you

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.050
and trying you together.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.780
Take him away!

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.490
Yes.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.190
An imperial decree!

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.100
Zhuge Tong and Zhuge Kongyun

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.040
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.340
Fang Tianzheng
of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.260
heed the order!

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.610
His Majesty commands

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.460
the three of you
to enter the palace at once.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.860
Where is Yesha, Xiao Beiming, now?

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.050
Your Majesty,

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.950
he's detained
at the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.020
Xiao Beiming

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.309
was wanted for three years

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.100
and had been nowhere to be seen.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.370
Now he's suddenly

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.200
appeared in public.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.490
Give me an explanation.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.820
Give me an explanation!

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.340
Your Majesty,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.710
I think he appeared

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.250
for the girl.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.730
Xiao Beiming appeared
at the execution ground

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.610
to save Zhong Xueman.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:53.970
Absurd!

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:55.620
Your Majesty,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.130
as for why Xiao Beiming

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.420
suddenly appeared

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.550
and what he's after,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.580
we'll know once we interrogate him.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.460
Now that he's in custody,

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.720
which of your two units

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.970
will interrogate him?

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:07.770
Naturallyâ€¦

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.770
Naturally, the Elite Constabulary Unit
should do it.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.470
Zhuge Kongyun,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.700
the Yesha case

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.370
has always been handled

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.370
by your Secret Investigation Unit,

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.300
and he is

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.010
also detained at your unit,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.220
so why do you say

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.680
he should be interrogated
by the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.300
I have my reasons

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.090
for making this suggestion.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:32.890
Your Majesty,

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:33.700
Xiao Beiming and I

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.850
grew up together.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.100
We've been
dealing with each other for years.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.060
To be fair,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.340
I have never bested him.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.100
Moreover, Xiao Beiming

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.700
was formerly a constable
of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.540
a man of great talent,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.850
solving countless cases.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.250
He knows normal punishments
and interrogation methods

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.220
better than anyone.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.340
They're useless on him.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.580
If he doesn't want to talk,

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.700
no amount of torture

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.850
will get even

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.050
half a word out of him.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.940
And the Yesha case is not an ordinary one.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.730
Several high-ranking officials
have been killed over the years,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.850
along with civilians,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.730
causing serious unrest.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.130
Even with Xiao Beiming captured,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.540
if we cannot uncover his schemes

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.010
and eliminate all his accomplices,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.610
the Qi Kingdom

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.460
will remain in turmoil.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.300
So are you saying

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.370
there's nothing we can do about him?

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.940
No.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.300
Maybe one person could help.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:14.890
Who?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.870
Zhong Xueman.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.700
Why her?

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.010
Xiao had been hiding for three years,

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.730
and his sudden appearance today

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.300
must have something to do
with Zhong Xueman.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.890
Whether he's still into her or not,

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.700
no one knows Xiao Beiming

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.250
better than Zhong Xueman.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.570
Fang Tianzheng.

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:33.530
Your Majesty.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.870
The interrogation of Xiao Beiming

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.250
will be handled

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.650
by your Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.540
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.060
You may go.

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.900
Your Majesty.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:54.130
There's something else?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.970
Your Majesty,

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.060
the key criminal Huang Wuchang

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.460
escaped from my custody.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.940
It was my dereliction of duty,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.540
and my advice to my father

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.700
almost caused the wrongful execution

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.890
of Constable Zhong Xueman.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.490
Although Xiao Beiming's appearance

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.010
has brought progress in the Yesha case,

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.100
I know my mistakes are unforgivable

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.610
and ask Your Majesty to punish me.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.100
Very well.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.420

you're forbidden
from working on any cases

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.010

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.490

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.550
you may return to work.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.890

I'll walk in myself.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.610
in all of the Qi Kingdom.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:22.370
I never imagined

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.260
that you and I would meet

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.640
under these circumstances.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.900
I didn't expect this either.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.360
Maybe it's better.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.690
When we worked together before,

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.100
we never had a chance

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.370
like today

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.690
to have a calm conversation.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.300
I promise,

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.540
I'll tell you everything I know

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:46.820
and hold nothing back.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.540
Good.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:49.950
Then let me ask youâ€”

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.170
are you,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:54.940
or are you not, Yesha?

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.540
Young Master is awake.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.450
Father,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.500
are there many questions

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.130
you want to ask me?

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.690
I do have a lot of questions.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.980
These past few days,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.450
everything you've done

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.930
feels so unfamiliar to me,

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:22.610
as if I don't know you anymore.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.300
Are you still my son?

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.890
Li Long,

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:29.330
help me up.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.680
Okay.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:30.650
Lie still.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.690
The whole world believes I'm Yesha.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.190
Why do you still ask that, Chief Fang?

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:47.650
I once believed this

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:49.300
without a doubtâ€”

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.410
until you showed up

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.030
at the execution ground today.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.300
By all logic,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.630
the one who hates you most
in this world

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.690
should be Zhong Xueman.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.060
After all, her father

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.890
died tragically on Fengbo Lake.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.300
If she saw you,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.740
even if she didn't cut you into pieces,

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.740
she would certainly do everything

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.020
to throw you in prison to face justice.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:13.650
But instead, sheâ€¦

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.740
And youâ€”

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.690
if you were truly the evil Yesha,

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:22.540
with so many lives

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.060
lost at your hand,

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.580
as cold and merciless as you were,

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.500
how would you have revealed yourself

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.210
just for a woman?

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:37.450
There must be

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.500
more to it.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:41.890
So,

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:43.650
you have second thoughts.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.260
So,

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.410
are you, or aren't you?

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:48.820
Did you already know

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.620
Xiao Beiming was in the capital?

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.210
It was just a feeling.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.650
No proof.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.210
But the word "feeling"

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.140
has already become taboo to you.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.540
I asked you to execute Zhong Xueman,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.500
but it was a gamble.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.980
I wasn't certain at all.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.930
You wonâ€”

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.890
won against Xiao Beiming for once.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.790
But what I don't understand is,

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:15.860
now that Xiao Beiming has shown up,

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.540
he should be under the control
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:21.170
That way, the Yesha case could be closed,

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:22.300
and our unit

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.260
would gain endless glory

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.540
and trample the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.300
completely underfoot.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.020
Yet you handed Xiao Beiming over

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.820
to the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.300
Father,

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.020
do you think what I said

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.820
to His Majesty in court
was just an excuse?

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.220
Whether I'm Yesha or not

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.000
must be proven with evidence.

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:40.850
Chief Fang,

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:41.780
for the past three years,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.780
I've been searching for the truth.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.650
I can tell you

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.170
everything I know.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.960
As for whether I am Yesha or not,

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.100
you can judge for yourself.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.690
Go ahead.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.100
It all started

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.410
in a place

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.690
called Haiya

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.020
and with an army

00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.370
called the Canfeng Army.

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.020
Why have I never heard of them?

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.260
A place that has disappeared

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.660
from the Qi Kingdom's map

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.370
and an army

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.370
that slaughtered countless civilians.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.690
My master Zhong Yunchi

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.370
and General Huo Zongyao

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.650
both served in this army.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:16.890
Actually,

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.710
I haven't really
won over Xiao Beiming this time.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.650
What do you mean?

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.410
You forced him to appear,

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.340
which he certainly didn't expect.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.600
Xiao Beiming is no ordinary man.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.340
If he dared show up
at the execution ground,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.060
he must have had a backup plan.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.610
He would never just surrender

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:33.940
and wait for execution.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.660
If we couldn't get him to talk

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.660
and didn't dare execute him,

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.710
we'd be caught in a bind.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.540
If he wouldn't confess,
we'd just execute him

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.850
and close the case.

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.580
I never found Haiya.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:47.170
Everything I know about it

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.210
came from Yesha's subordinates.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.450
Whether it existed

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.500
and whether that massacre truly happened

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.930
still need to be verified.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:54.980
What about Yesha?

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.300
I suspect

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.520
he's an orphan from Haiya.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.300
An orphan from Haiya?

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.930
The murder of high-ranking officials
three years ago

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:07.300
and the Fengbo Lake caseâ€”

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.930
both were Yesha's revenge.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.500
Or rather,

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.740
the revenge of the Haiya orphans.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.890
And this revenge

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.340
still hasn't stopped.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.210
Do you have proof?

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.130
Before Old Bug died,

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.210
I was there.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.340
He told me himself

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.580
that Yesha had ordered him

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.690
to make a certain pillâ€”

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.340
one with immense power.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.930
If it were successfully made,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.390
the Qi Kingdom would fall.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.780
Then investigate it.

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.670
No.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.690
At least, you mustn't.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.540
Why not?

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.740
Because this is a taboo

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.060
for the Qi Kingdom.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.010
Unless you don't care about
your own life anymore.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.100
I admit,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.650
interrogating Xiao Beiming

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.580
will not go smoothly.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.850
But even if we get nothing from him,

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.820
or he dies during interrogation,

00:24:58.260 --> 00:24:59.890
closing the Yesha case

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.880
would only benefit
the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.890
What about the truth?

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.340
Isn't the truth what matters most?

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.020
The truth matters,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.780
but it depends on

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.890
whose hands it's in.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:15.780
If the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.890
discovers the truth,

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.300
then it's worthlessâ€”

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.010
even worse than having no truth at all.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.650
So by your logic,

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.930
I can't keep investigating.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.920
Huang Wuchangâ€”

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.170
he should have seen Yesha.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:34.890
Our top priority now

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.550
is to capture Huang Wuchang
as soon as possible.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:44.540
The Qi Kingdom will fall.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.060
The Qi Kingdom will fall.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.580
What a bold claim.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.650
If Xiao Beiming died

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.740
and Yesha's underlings struck again,

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:02.780
what should we do?

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.300
Kill them if they come.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.460
Leave none alive.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.020
But would His Majesty

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.500
give us another chance?

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.260
Father,

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.190
passing this hot potato
to the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.410
is already

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.890
protecting ourselves.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.690
Please trust me one more time.

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.610
This case

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.210
won't end so soon.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.340
We'll have another chance.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.300
You just stay here and rest well.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.130
Reflect on your mistakes.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.500
Since I've been handed over
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.410
my life is in your hands.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.060
You now have three choices.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.740
First,

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.060
declare me to be Yesha,

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.340
close the Yesha case,

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.930
and even execute me.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.500
But if Yesha kills people again
in the future,

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.370
the consequences will be unimaginable,

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:57.300
and that may not be something

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.540
you can bear.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.030
And the second?

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.190
Second,

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.850
keep me in custody for now

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.890
while the Elite Constabulary Unit
pursues Huang Wuchang.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:10.450
But with your current capabilities,

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.890
whether you can catch him is uncertain.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.890
This is a game,

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:14.170
a race against time.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.130
What's at stake are countless lives,

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.210
even those of innocent civilians.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:19.740
If we lose to time

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.450
or to Yesha,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.610
either will be

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.100
a major disaster.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.320
And the third?

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.930
Trust me.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.460
Let me go capture Huang Wuchang.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.280
Stop pacing in front of me.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.170
Stop pacing in front of me!

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:12.980
Uncle,

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.890
you came.

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.340
Please sit.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:23.580
Here, Uncle.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.200
Chief,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.900
Xiao Beiming is not Yesha.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.450
I can stake my life on it.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:28.300
So can I.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:30.210
I can be a witness.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.820
I can vouch for Beiming.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.020
Stop calling him that.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.020
He's a suspect.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.280
What proof do you have?

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:40.930
Just your empty words?

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.170
To stake your lives on it?

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.020
Are your lives

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.820
even in your own hands right now?

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.060
Do you realize

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.660
how serious your crimes are?

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:56.740
Chief,

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.340
I admit I concealed

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.690
information about Xiao Beiming.

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:00.820
It was my idea

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.170
and had nothing to do with anyone else.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.830
I'll take sole responsibility
for shelteringâ€¦

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.500
Xiao Beiming is indeed a key criminal,

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.580
but whether you sheltered himâ€”

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:12.100
think that over.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:14.340
Chief.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.890
Fang Yin, write this down.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:22.890
Constable Zhong,

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:25.550
upon learning of the whereabouts

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.440
of the key criminal Xiao Beiming,

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:29.170
immediately reported to me

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.400
and requested to make the arrest.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.370
However, I believe

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.580
Xiao Beiming is of great importance

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.060
and may be hiding

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.020
great secrets.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.260
For the safety of the Qi Kingdom,

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.580
I assign Constable Zhong

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:48.740
to use her past ties
to get close to the key criminal,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:49.580
gain his trust,

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.310
and obtain more intelligence.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:52.300
Now,

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:53.980
Xiao Beiming

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:55.510
has been captured.

00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.500
The mission to apprehend him

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.140
is officially complete.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:01.300
I

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.130
will report your bravery and fearlessness

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.590
to the Ministry of Justice

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.340
and request commendations.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.240
Fang Yin, have you written all that down?

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.060
Did you hear

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.060
what I just said?

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.980
Y-Yes,

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.340
but...

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.170
But what?

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.370
You want to disobey your chief's order?

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:24.980
I wouldn't dare.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.040
I'll write it down.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.570
Thank you, Chief.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:29.940
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.890
You flatter me.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.930
Constable Zhong,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.500
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:34.740
by His Majesty's order,

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.500
you are now

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:36.930
in charge of

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.990
interrogating Xiao Beiming, alias Yesha.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.540
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.100
Since it's His Majesty's order,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.160
while Xiao Beiming is held

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.370
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:43.650
at the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.910
you may go in
and question him at any time.

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.210
I've called back Mo Chong and Liu Feng

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.580
to guard the suspect.

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:50.740
As for how to conduct

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.230
the interrogation,

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:55.580
it's up to you.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.810
Yes.

00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.370
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.890
Go.

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:00.690
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.220
Let's go.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.260
Let's go.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.090
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.340
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.060
Why are all of you

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.400
still standing around here?

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.300
Can't I have a moment of peace?

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.780
â™ª An elegant gentleman â™ª

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.060
â™ª Beauty, yet prejudice â™ª

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.890
Go away.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.740
â™ª With courage â™ª

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.380
â™ª The gentleman understands â™ª

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.300
â™ª Traveling freely in this world â™ª

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.640
All these years as an official,

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:25.850
â™ª Only wielding his sword â™ª

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:26.710
I never thought

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.650
I'd end up betting my life

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.800
on a suspect.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.360
â™ª I cry alone â™ª

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.460
â™ª Grieving over past grievances â™ª

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.680
â™ª Thinking about you again and again â™ª

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.040
â™ª It's just one glance â™ª

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:44.020
â™ª And I can't sleep at night â™ª

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.100
The suspect is here.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.220
How would you like to interrogate me?

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.140
Whipping or caning?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.080
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:50.850
Beiming.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.020
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:53.650
Beiming.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.340
Be gentle.

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.740
I haven't recovered yet.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.060
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.110
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:06.670
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:11.060
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.700
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.260
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:23.090
â™ª The gentleman understands â™ª

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.670
Come on.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.370
After great peril comes great fortune.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.300
Let me down this bowl of wine first.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.710
Tong Shuang,

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:37.060
take it slow.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.410
You can't hold your liquor.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.500
I'm happy today.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.760
I'll drink more later.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:42.340
Give me a break.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:43.650
This is like

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:45.300
taking off your pants to fight a tigerâ€”

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.930
reckless and shameless.

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.340
I can make a wisecrack too.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.200
Fine, go ahead.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.260
Madman, you must have

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.020
mistaken arsenic for candy todayâ€”

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.680
you've got a venomous tongue.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.340
When did you learn

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.140
all these bizarre expressions?

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.370
I learned them at the escort agency.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.300
Didn't learn much else,

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.300
just picked up these lines.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.060
But, Madman,

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.980
you should learn from me in the future.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.540
That way,

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.890
all young ladies

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.820
will like you.

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:08.940
What do you mean?

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.850
What do I mean?

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:15.890
Come on.

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:16.890
Let's celebrate

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.060
Beiming and Xueman's survival
through this ordeal.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:19.710
-Come on.
-Come on.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:20.100
Come on.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:20.780
Cheers.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:26.210
I never expected

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:28.500
Chief Fang to be so righteous
and sensible.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.540
I was too harsh

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.370
on him before.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.100
From now on,

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.830
I should show him more respect.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.730
Actually, for us to get this far,

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:37.930
there's one more person we should thank.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:38.400
Who is it?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.090
Who?

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.170
Zhuge Kongyun.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:41.820
Who? That sinister guy?

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.410
He's behind every bad thing

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:45.580
that's happened.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:46.890
He and his father worked together

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:48.210
to frame Constable Zhong.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:48.650
Beiming,

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:50.100
if you hadn't shown up in time,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.370
we'd be mourning

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.300
at her grave right now.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:54.340
Shut up.

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:55.820
I'm telling the truth.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.930
That's true.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.300
I used to think Zhuge Kongyun was

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:00.690
just a bad person.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:01.640
Now I think

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:03.410
he's downright vicious.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.370
Thankfully, His Majesty is wise

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:06.890
and let the Elite Constabulary Unit
take over.

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.540
If the Secret Investigation Unit
had taken you,

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.060
the consequences would be devastating.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:10.860
His Majesty even gave

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.210
that playboy 30 strokes of the rod.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.980
It served him right.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.060
Some things

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.570
might not be what you think.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.630
That day in Weizhou,

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.280
when Zhuge Kongyun
approached the carriage,

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.159
he had already

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.469
noticed me,

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:28.310
maybe even earlier than that.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.810
Get well soon.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:33.460
Then why didn't he

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.790
arrest you at that time?

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:36.870
If he had made a move in Weizhou,

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:38.270
what would you have done?

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.020
If he had dared harm you,

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:40.810
I would have

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:42.100
taken his life.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:43.730
He definitely

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:44.989
knew your intentions.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.620
There are two reasons why he didn't act.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:48.500
First,

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.130
he didn't want to see

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.330
the two units

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:53.190
turn on each other at that moment.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:53.940
Second,

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.980
he had a question in his mind.

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.900
What question?

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.030
Why were you all

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.420
with me?

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.130
Zhuge Kongyun was never

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.580
a cruel man,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.250
but he tried
to execute his junior sister in public.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.250
He did that for one reason onlyâ€”

00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.980
to draw me out.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.210
How horrible.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.220
He's nothing but a despicable man.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.170
It was an act of desperation.

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:16.810
His Majesty had given

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:17.540
him and his father

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.770
just three more days.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.170
If they had failed to lure me out,

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:20.940
their lives

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:21.940
would have been forfeit.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:22.690
So that makes it fine

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:23.380
to trade your life

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.420
for theirs?

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.900
Alright, calm down.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.590
Aren't I safe and sound now?

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.100
Easy for you to say.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:31.420
That's because you were

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.980
lucky enough to meet Chief Fang.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.250
It was Zhuge Kongyun

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.840
who requested in court

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.720
for the Elite Constabulary Unit
to interrogate me.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.610
Closing the Yesha case

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.460
would only benefit
the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.660
What about the truth?

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.660
Isn't the truth what matters most?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:49.100
The two once-renowned elite constables

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.250
of the Qi Kingdom

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.460
have both used victims as bait
to draw out the killers

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.540
without the slightest scruple.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:55.810
Even if the case

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.040
is solved that way, what's the point?

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.420
I never thought

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.650
that after all these years,

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.580
not only would you not have changed,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.450
you'd have become even more despicable,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.710
not even caring about the truth anymore!

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:09.610
Even so,

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.180
all he's done is just
made up for his mistakes.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.210
That's precisely the problem.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:16.500
You're willing to believe me,

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.650
stay by my side,

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:18.810
and protect me.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.770
But in everyone else's eyes,

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.100
I am Yesha.

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:23.980
Zhuge Kongyun

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.380
was in charge of the Yesha case.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.810
Even if he had killed me,

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.170
it'd be seen as justified.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.630
So what mistake would there be
to make up for?

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:32.500
Are you saying

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.260
he also believes you're not Yesha?

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.580
At the very least, I'm now

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.860
reunited with you.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.210
Zhuge Kongyun is

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.610
truly hard to read.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.900
Not really.

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.420
Everything he's done

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.210
has been for one thing.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.170
What's that?

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.500
The truth.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:58.620
I've done everything I can.

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.500
Now,

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.850
it's your turn.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.820
Right now, the top priority

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:05.860
is to find Huang Wuchang

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.940
as soon as possible.

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.650
But Chief Fang

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:09.460
only gave us permission
to see you at any time,

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.580
not to take you out for investigation.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.380
That's fine.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.740
I still have you.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.860
So where do we

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.860
start our investigation?

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.810
We still need to start

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:19.580
with how Huang Wuchang was taken.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.610
He was taken away

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:21.810
with poison.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.290
But the escort route was top secret,

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:26.130
so how did anyone find out?

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.860
Zhuge Kongyun also suspected

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.940
there was a mole inside,

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.650
but he never found out who.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.060
Even if there was a mole,

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.170
how did they learn about

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.900
the escort route?

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:37.420
First, we need to know

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.170
how that route was decided

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:40.500
and who knew about it.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.380
As far as I know,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.330
Zhuge Tong changed the route
at the last minute,

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:44.650
instead of taking the original road

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:45.940
from Weizhou back to the capitalâ€”

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.580
just to prevent leaks.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:48.980
In that case,

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.940
only Zhuge Tong

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.800
and Zhuge Kongyun knew the route.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.690
Zhuge Kongyun was in Weizhou at that time,

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.420
and Zhuge Tong was in the capital.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:58.020
When they changed the route,

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.420
how did they pass along

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.420
the information?

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.860
It's during the transmission

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.320
that a leak is most likely.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.100
Find out

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.900
their method of communication.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.100
The Secret Investigation Unit

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.430
has its own way of sending messages.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.490
We need to ask Zhuge Kongyun about it.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:13.580
But he's currently locked up

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.290
in the Secret Investigation Unit's prison.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:16.060
We need to find a way

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.060
to see him.
