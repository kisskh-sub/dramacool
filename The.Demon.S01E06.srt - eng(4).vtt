00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:13.879
This person is clearly a mortal.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.439
Why does he have a demon core inside him?

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:30.920
Such a creature

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.840
should not be allowed to exist in this world.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.920
Chief Fan.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.200
Chief Fan.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.959
Why are you hitting him?

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:42.640
A mortal body,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.000
yet such a powerful demon core.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.599
Could he be an ancient demon in disguise?

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.439
Shen Wangchen.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:47.799
Go back to the demon stronghold first.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.280
I promised you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.599
not to harm the innocent.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400
But I never promised not to hurt demon hunters.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.799
Step aside.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.519
I need to take him away today.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.480
Si Ming.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.879
I'm the most powerful demon here.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.760
If you won't take me, I'll take him.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.359
Who are you looking down on?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.520
Are you human or demon?

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.800
Sorry for any offense.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.240
Chief Fan, move aside.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.639
Who asked you to meddle?

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.000
Are you alright?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.759
None of your business.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.919
This medicine heals internal energy injuries.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:43.840
It's the most effective.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.560
Don't be so impatient next time.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.800
Take care of yourself first.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.159
Don't die before I even get to fight you.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.560
You might just die from illness first.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.680
Minions, your king has returned!

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.319
Minions!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.199
Cousin.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.800
Everyone couldn't stand your torment.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.840
They all ran away.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.199
Ran away?

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:16.000
Where did they go?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.439
Everyone quit.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.560
They took their belongings and left.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.319
Sorry for your loss.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.159
How could this happen?

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.240
Was I not good to them?

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.599
You always

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.039
fly into a rage

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.439
and use threats and bribes.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.719
Actually, they told me long ago

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:39.240
they wanted to quit.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.319
They said

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.319
if there's anything else

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.479
I did wrong.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.560
No one mentioned anything else.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.479
I'm not really sure.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.840
Rule number 868:

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.879
To build public trust,

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.919
one must keep their word.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:03:59.479
But you...

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.199
Enough!

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.680
I am the great

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.719
undefeated Demon King of Qianchun Mountain!

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.080
How could I tolerate such humiliation?

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.719
They'd better never come back.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.879
Cousin.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.519
Xiao Er.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.360
Why do you always come here

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.759
when you're in a bad mood?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.600
Xiao Er, how have you been lately?

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.800
Not good at all.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.120
I'm so annoyed I could die.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.399
At least you're still useful.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.160
Serve your king well

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:01.279
to ease my troubles.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.720
Now that's relaxing.

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:25.319
Master,

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.000
my powers are lacking.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:28.759
I failed to defeat Chief Fan.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.600
Si Ming.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.680
You've gone after that tiger demon again and again.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.279
Do you want to catch her

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.040
or just see her?

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:44.759
As a cultivator,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.839
the greatest taboo is falling for mortal desires.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.240
I wouldn't dare.

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.199
Don't disappoint me again.

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:03.639
Yes.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.319
It's getting late. Go rest.

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.079
Master.

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:12.759
Have you ever seen a mortal

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:13.680
with a demon core inside?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.519
There are records of it in our sect's scrolls.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.600
If a demon

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.519
transfers its demon core to a mortal,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.879
this will happen.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.399
But once the demon core leaves the body,

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:25.959
the demon will surely die.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.120
Why are you asking about this?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.680
I was reading ancient texts today

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:31.920
and became curious.

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:33.439
Deal with that tiger demon as soon as possible.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.480
Yes.

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:44.680
Those brats...

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.160
Still haven't come back.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:46.959
If on the way

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:47.639
someone snatched them,

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.759
what should I do?

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.600
Chief Fan.

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:56.000
I've told you before,

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.279
using threats and bribes

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.600
won't keep friends around.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.240
What use are friends to me?

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.560
Then they'll never

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.360
come back.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.279
Even if they're taken away,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.360
they still wouldn't want to live with you.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.959
Am I really that unlikeable?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.879
Calm your mind like still water.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.000
Free yourself from desire.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.720
Unite your mind and spirit.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.000
Let go of all things and self.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.319
Do you truly have a way

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.639
to bring them all back?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.839
And make them even more loyal to me?

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.720
There is a way.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.040
But, Chief Fan,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.600
what is it?

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:27.839
If you can't be honest with them,

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:28.920
then likewise,

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.000
you won't earn

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.879
their genuine respect and trust.

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.600
It must be because lately

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.679
they couldn't defeat you.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.159
They think I'm not strong enough.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.480
So they all left.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:40.039
They went to find another way.

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:46.480
They didn't leave

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.840
because you weren't strong enough.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.559
Force can't win people's hearts.

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:54.720
Only sincerity can earn sincerity.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.200
You already have

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.519
the kindest heart in the world.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:06.360
Why not let everyone see it?

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.639
Xiao Er.
