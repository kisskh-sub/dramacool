00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.310
I'd take him

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.370

that after solving the case,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.680

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.970
to the tofu maker's daughter
on West Street.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.270
He trusted me so much

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.070
and left everything in my hands,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.720

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.190
This isn't your fault.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.390
It is.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.070
It's my fault.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.630
It's all my fault.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.920
If I hadn't taken him in back then…

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.600
If I hadn't asked him

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.930

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.040

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.190

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.390
he would've been fine.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.630
Beiming, stop blaming yourself.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.870

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.390

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:29.890
What are you doing?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.659
Are you thinking clearly now?

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:37.240
Xiao Beiming,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.190
look at yourself right now—

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.390
lost and confused,

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.560
dejected and depressed.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.120
No one wants

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.250
to see you like this!

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.560
Coroner Feng has nothing to do
with the Yesha case,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.770
yet he's been risking his life

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.720
with us all this time.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.850
Why is he doing that?

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.000
Dairong doesn't know martial arts,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.080
yet she insisted on coming

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.000
with us to Haiya.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.070
Why did she do that?

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.280
Chief Fang and Zhuge Kongyun

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.540
hold official positions in the capital.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.020
But they're risking the lives

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.680
of their whole families for us.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.040
Why are they doing that?

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.110
You're grieving, but who isn't?

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.440
You have regrets, but who doesn't?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.360
But this matter

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.430
isn't over yet.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.510
Look at you now.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.070
Are you giving up?

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.550
You want to go to Lonely Town.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.510
Fine.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:31.870
I'll go with you.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.059
You want to dig through rocks?

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:34.150
I'll dig with you.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:35.750
If we can't find him in a year,

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.480
we'll dig for two.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.270
If not in two,

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:38.240
then 10—

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.840
until we find him.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.870
Then let him look at you,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.940
look at the man

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.270
he sacrificed his life to save,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.660
look at the big brother

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.390
he valued more than his own life.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.120
Let him see what you've become.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.720
Then you can ask him yourself

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.130
if it was worth it and if he'd regret it.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.440
Aren't you going?

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.040
Let's go.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.300
I'll go with you.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.550
We all went searching,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.360
but all we found in the rubble

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.720
was this.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.790
I understand how you feel right now,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.550
because everyone

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.510
here

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.340
has experienced

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.000
the pain of losing loved ones.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.460
But besides wiping away the tears

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.120
and gritting your teeth to live on,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.520
there's no other choice.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.410
Because worse than losing your life

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.410
is losing

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.840
hope.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.260
Thank you

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.820

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.630
I'm truly sorry

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.550
we couldn't help you more.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.790
Beiming.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.360

we haven't finished.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.690
You've worked hard for so long

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.540
and can finally get some rest.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.290
Just have a good sleep

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.120
and wait for me to return.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.370
I'll bring you

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.050

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.120

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.240
stop thinking about her.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.170
With your hot temper,

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.960
you'd probably scare her off.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.320
Tong Shuang,

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.150
just watch.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.870
Watch Beiming

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.990
catch Yesha with us.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.550
[Here lies Tong Shuang,
Xiao Beiming's brother]

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.070
We will catch him,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.600
avenge you and your family,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.930
and then bring you home.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.150
Trust me.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.550
It won't be long.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.200
We'll be back soon.

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.720
Let's go.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:14.960
[Here lies Tong Shuang,
Xiao Beiming's brother]

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:24.750
Are you saying

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.240
my brother and the others were poisoned

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.270
because of the water?

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:28.070
That's right.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.130
They drank water from Lonely Town.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.750
What's wrong with the water?

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.950
So many people died

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.790
in Lonely Town back then.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.080
There must have been a lot of corpses,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.020
but inside the town,

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.550
we didn't see many remains.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.630
So I think

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.670
the Canfeng Army

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.360
must have burned

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.360
all those bodies.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.120
What about the burned remains?

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.790
They were dumped into that lake.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.960
It's stagnant water,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.150
and over the years,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.150
the pill toxin spread
throughout the entire lake.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:51.870
I guess

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.200
your brother and his group

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.220
came into contact with it

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.480
while gathering supplies

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.720
in the town,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.080
and that's how they got poisoned.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.080
After they returned,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.000
the poison gradually took effect.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.400
So that's what happened.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.750
As for those wild beasts,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.320
they probably drank from the lake too

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.790
while foraging in the town.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:09.240
After generations,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.050
they've turned into

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:11.790
the crazed beasts we see now.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.360
I-Is there a cure for this poison?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.000
Although we don't have a cure now,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.920
we've obtained

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.910
the Swift Wind Pill's formula.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.240
We have the best physician with us.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.070
He'll definitely

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:30.200
create an antidote.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.080
But before then,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.840
if you must go to Lonely Town,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.790
don't touch the lake water.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:37.960
I understand.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.910
The danger isn't over yet.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:40.960
Are you sure

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.220
you won't come with us?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.000
Mr. Xiao,

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.270
we're grateful for everything

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.000
you and your friends have done,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.150
but the journey ahead is too dangerous.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.870
We'd only

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.000
slow you down.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:54.910
Most importantly,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.360
no matter what,

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.320
this is our home.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.270
Until this is resolved,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.460
we don't wish

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.090
to set foot in the Qi Kingdom.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.840
I understand.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.960
But if anyone

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.790
should be thankful, it's me.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.390
Thank you for waking me up,

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.790
for reminding me

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:14.030
what the living

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.390
should do.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:16.910
I promise you,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.320
my friends and I

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.150
will make sure the people of Haiya

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.070
get an answer.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.010
Let us help.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.140
-Thank you.
-Let me.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.720
Thank you, Miss Xiaoyue and Miss Luo,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:36.790
for looking after us all this time.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.790
Don't mention it.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.030
Thank you.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.390
We couldn't have done it

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.390
without your help.

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:51.320
That hope—

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.850
we'll keep it in our hearts

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.560
and never go back on our word.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.320
Farewell.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.600
Take care.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:54.010
This white jade thumb ring

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.840
was the key

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.650
Bei Hai gave my father back then,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.890
but my father never told me a thing.

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:01.570
Master didn't tell you

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:02.980
because he wanted

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.440
to end all of this himself.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.200
Beiming,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.640
have you already...

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.240
It all started with

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.440
the Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.590
Back when the late emperor
was gravely ill,

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.850
those four officials were senior aides.

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.700
According to my father's records,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.080
these four officials were the ones

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.600
[Kill]

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.810
who orchestrated the Haiya massacre.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.110
When Yesha took revenge,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:23.790
they were on the kill list.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.460
My father served in the Canfeng Army.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.230
He knew right away

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.200
that the Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.310
was connected to Haiya.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.160
Not just that,

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.750
even before the Fengbo Lake case,

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.720
Master had already known

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
who Yesha was.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.070
The real Yesha,

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:38.440
or rather the first Yesha,

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.680
was Miao Jie.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.550
Miao Jie?

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.590
After the Canfeng Army disbanded,

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:45.590
Miao Jie transferred
to the Ministry of Personnel

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.350
and later became
the Minister of the Imperial Secretariat.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.880
With the intelligence network
of the Imperial Secretariat,

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.930
he could easily track those

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.070
who advised

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:52.270
and promoted the massacre,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.480
as well as the whereabouts
of the Canfeng Army members.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.510
But that isn't enough to prove

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.650
that Yesha was Miao Jie.

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.050
[Zhong Yunchi]

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.400
That's right.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.960
He served in the Canfeng Army too.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.620
It makes no sense that after the massacre,

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.920
he'd seek revenge against himself.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.640
Exactly.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.760
Mr. Zhong and my father

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.070
were both in the Canfeng Army,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.050
and they remained silent

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.480
about what happened back then.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.040
There's no way

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.240
they had thought about revenge.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.790
Because Miao Jie

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.400
was different from everyone else.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.750
Miao Jie was from Haiya.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.720
He witnessed his hometown

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.440
being massacred with his own eyes.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.500
He was also the first orphan of Haiya.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.790
How do you know

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.030
he was from Haiya?

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.000
This gesture looks familiar.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.830
I think I saw it somewhere before.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.510
This is the gesture

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.880
the Haiya people made
at Luo Sen's funeral.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.590
That's right.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.720
I asked Luo Shu about it.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.350
She told me

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:37.750
it's a farewell gesture,

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.870
meant to guide the souls of the deceased

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:39.830
back to their homeland.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:41.490
It's a custom unique to Haiya.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.360
But that wasn't

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.790
the first time I'd seen it.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.880
The first time

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.270
was three years ago.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:47.880
Three years ago?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.370
When I saw it,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.000
I didn't think much of it.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.640
I thought Miao Jie did it unintentionally.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:52.720
[Lu Wenzhong] [Qin Ye]

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.570
But now it seems

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.960
[Shen Bi] [Huo Zongyao]

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.720
Miao Jie was indeed
bidding farewell to the dead,

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.110
[Zhong Yunchi] [Fan Jingzhi]

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:57.720
but the one he was saying goodbye to

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.880
was himself.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.080
He wished

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.270
his soul could return home.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.480
The entire Fengbo Lake case

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.510
was a death trap

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.200
that he and Master set for each other.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.220
They used themselves as bait

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.870
and staked their lives on it.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:14.270
I don't understand.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.110
I just said

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.830
Master had known who Yesha was

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.720
before the Fengbo Lake case.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.470
[Ghostly Judge Yin Er,
Psychic Mei Baiyu, Minister Miao Jie]

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.160
I understand now.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.000
Miao Jie and my father
fought side by side on the battlefield.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.400
My father knew he was from Haiya.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.510
So when Miao Jie's name appeared

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:29.750
among the three suspects,

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.600
my father connected

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.350
all the dots.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.680
From start to finish,

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.480
he had his eyes

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.480
on Miao Jie alone.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.200
Exactly.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.790
And Master knew

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.880
that Miao Jie's next target

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.800
would be him.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:39.930
That's why he set up

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.200
the trap at Fengbo Lake

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.070
and why he left final instructions
with us.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.350
If I fall

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.720
in the fight with Yesha this time,

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.030
having you by her side

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.200
will set my mind at ease.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.550
What exactly

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.550
was my father's plan at Fengbo Lake?

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.830
I believe Master's original plan

00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:59.440
was to put knockout drops

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.590
in the tea on the ship.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.160
The unsuspecting Yin Er and Mei Baiyu

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.510
would certainly drink it and pass out.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.750
Miao Jie was right.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.680
Master meant to kill him to silence him.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.240
For the stability of the Qi Kingdom,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.200
Master had already prepared

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.550
to sacrifice himself.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.880
How was that possible?

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.720
Are you saying my father poisoned himself?

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.720
Because that poison was used twice.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.640
What?

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.440
Back then, after Miao Jie fell for

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.680
the four-carriage trap,

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.880
he knew his identity

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.750
couldn't be hidden anymore,

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.400
and he knew our wedding

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.790
was just nothing but a trap.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:25.960
He even foresaw

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.110
all of Master's plans.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.070
So that means

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.460
the second poisoning…

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.960
It was done by Miao Jie.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.280
He replaced the incense on the ship

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.310
with knockout drops,

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.330
so whether they drank

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.160
Master's tea or not,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.510
they'd be poisoned and pass out—

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.440
something Master never anticipated.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.250
Afterward, Zhu Yitie

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:40.350
followed Miao Jie's orders

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.350
and sewed and killed

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.720
everyone on the ship except me,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.320
including Miao Jie himself.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.920
This is the true story

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.600
behind the Fengbo Lake case.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.400
If he had known

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.640
all the plans,

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.000
why didn't he run?

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.110
Why did he have to

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.160
kill himself too?

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.070
And why did he spare your life?

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.470
That doesn't make sense.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:58.880
Because for Miao Jie,

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.750
his own death
was the most important step.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.640
He wanted to use his death

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:04.790
to kill

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.320
three birds with one stone.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.010
Three birds with one stone?

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.800
With his identity exposed,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.030
killing Master

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.310
was his first goal.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.270
And the second?

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.000
I was shot and fell into the lake.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:17.960
I blacked out

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and woke up in the shallows.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.880
I thought I was just lucky,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.030
but now I realize

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.990
Miao Jie must have

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.350
instructed his men ahead of time,

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.110
making sure

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.440
I could survive

00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:28.720
and become a fugitive.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.120
As long as you were alive,

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.420
everyone's attention

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.350
would be on you.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.640
So his second goal

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.880
was to frame you.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.270
No.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:38.270
Framing me was just a cover-up.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.550
His second goal

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.750
was to hide someone—

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.920
the one we've been fighting all this time.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.580
That person

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.640
is also the one mentioned

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.200
by Qing Ying, Huang Wuchang, and Old Bug.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.680
He should be a young man

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.160
who's the second Yesha.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.750
The second Yesha?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.310
Miao Jie used his own death

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.920
to mislead all investigations,

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.200
making it impossible for us to verify

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.460
whether Zhu Yitie's testimony was true.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.750
My God,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.160
how could someone

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.890
be so scheming and terrifying?

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.830
The most terrifying part isn't that.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.290
Miao Jie's third goal—

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.110
and his most important one—

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:10.310
was me.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.030
He framed you,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.070
hid the second Yesha,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.280
forced you into a dead end,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.070
and nearly got you killed.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.240
What more could he want?

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.110
From the moment I boarded that ship,

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.120
everything was already

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.450
part of Miao Jie's plan.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:22.270
He knew

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.640
how close I was to Master,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.200
and he knew my competitive nature.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.830
Look,

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.640
I'm here with the guests.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.000
Nothing's improper here.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.830
Father, I...

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.550
Beiming, go back.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.270
Mr. Zhong,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.510
since the groom wants to come

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.000
and the bride doesn't mind,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.640
why not let him

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.040
go out on the lake with us?

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.240
A long time ago,

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.590
on the border of the Qi Kingdom,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.110
there was a small city

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.510
called Haiya.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.200
-What do you want to say?
-King Zhong of Constables,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.200
I suppose Constable Xiao has no idea

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:52.640
that you actually know

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.400
what Yesha really means.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:55.400
Have you never told him

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.640
because you're afraid

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.550
he'll discover what you did back then?

00:23:58.550 --> 00:23:59.680
So he deliberately mentioned

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.720
Haiya on the ship,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.110
forcing Master to attack him.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.640
Apart from making me suspect Master,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.510
his real aim

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.640
was to etch the word "Haiya"

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.880
on my mind.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
According to his plan,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.510
he knew that after I escaped,

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.400
I'd dig into everything about Haiya

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.510
to uncover that history.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:13.310
You mean

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:14.160
we...

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.030
Yes.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.880
Us being here now

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.920
is also part of his plan.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.930
How could he have

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.680
calculated things to this extent?

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.240
What about the second Yesha?

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.900
Have you figured out who it is?

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.400
[Miao Jie, male infant, Miao Yun]

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.830
The boy Miao Jie adopted back then.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.030
Miao Yun?

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.160
If Miao Jie had been
planning revenge all along,

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.550
then the boy he adopted

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.430
would indeed be the perfect successor.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.630
No, that's not right.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.350
We looked into that child.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.270
He

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.160
went missing.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.920
Whether he is

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.960
the second Yesha or not,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.360
we need to find him first.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:15.720
With less than 30 miles to go,

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.510
we can reach the capital tomorrow.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:18.640
We need to go faster.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.160
Chief Fang is covering for us.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.310
The sooner we get back,

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.270
the less trouble
for the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:24.680
Then we'll travel through the night

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.680
and try to reach the capital by dawn.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.480
We can go without rest,

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.010
but the horse needs to eat.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.480
Alright then,

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.150
let's take a short break.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.800
What's wrong?

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.300
Chief Fang has been taken
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.470
What happened?

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.640
Yesterday, my father

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.310
received a mysterious tip-off.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.240
He then led men to storm

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.440
the Elite Constabulary Unit's prison.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240
Fang Tianzheng,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.000
as the Chief
of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.480
you actually released a key criminal.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.810
Have you lost your mind?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:32.960
Tell me—

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:35.640
why did you release Xiao Beiming?

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.270
Where did he go?

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.320
Despite being tortured,

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.110
Chief Fang didn't say a word.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.830
However, His Majesty has decreed

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.710
that if he doesn't confess within 10 days,

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.230
he'll be executed

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.680
for releasing a key criminal.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680
Fortunately, you sent me a message

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.830
by carrier pigeon a few days ago

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.030
and told me about Haiya.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.080
Then I rushed here

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.310
as quickly as I could.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:07.510
We need to hurry back

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.240
to save Chief Fang.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.170
Absolutely not!

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.440
You are now

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.550
wanted criminals.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.550
The Elite Constabulary Unit
has been shut down,

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.750
and everyone you know

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.110
is being watched
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:18.720
If you go back and get caught,

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.200
everything will be over.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.320
But we've already uncovered

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.200
the secrets of Haiya

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.960
and figured out

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960
Yesha's identity.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.480
Yes.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.110
If we go back and tell the truth,

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.240
proving that the Fengbo Lake case

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.510
had nothing to do with Beiming,

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.570
the charge of releasing a key criminal

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:31.700
can be re-examined,

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.560
and Chief Fang will be saved.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.800
It's not too late

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.730
if we go back now.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.830
Beiming.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.750
Beiming.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.650
We can't reveal ourselves yet.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.440
Why not?

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.090
Even if we know

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.240
who the new Yesha is,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.750
Miao Jie is already dead.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.110
Right.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.580
Even if all your deductions

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.350
are correct,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.710
there isn't enough evidence

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:54.400
to prove them.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.480
More importantly,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.790
if we tried to prove

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.590
that I'm not Yesha

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.490
by revealing everything

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.820
we discovered at Haiya,

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.210
it'd mean exposing

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:02.920
that dark history to everyone.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.240
Neither His Majesty

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.590
nor the Qi Kingdom

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:06.880
is ready

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.070
to face it.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.750
The nation would be thrown into chaos,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.210
and that's exactly
what the new Yesha wants.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.680
So we'll just stand by

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.560
and watch Chief Fang be executed?

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.440
There's only one way
to break this deadlock.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440
Within 10 days,

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.160
we must capture the new Yesha.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.960
We need to find Miao Yun quickly.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.970
You sent me a message

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.550
by carrier pigeon a few days ago,

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.310
so I looked into Miao Yun's whereabouts.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.180
Miao Jie lived his entire life alone,

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.640
with no family or servants.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.880
He even ate and slept
at the Imperial Secretariat.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.270
He was aloof and cold

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.440
and never spoke of personal matters
to anyone,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.680
so no one knew

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.880
he had an adopted son.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.740
But his name is

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:40.830
on the registry.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.480
He might have hidden Miao Yun somewhere.

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.510
I thought so too,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.440
so I checked

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.030
all the documents related to him

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:47.550
and found that he bought a house

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:49.070
in Mount Nan, outside the capital.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.070
Very suspicious.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.680
Unfortunately, with what suddenly happened
with the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.110
I never had the chance to check it out.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:55.840
The situation has changed now.

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.240
If you continue investigating,

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.400
your father will become suspicious.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.200
I understand.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.020
I'll prepare some uniforms

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.720
of the Secret Investigation Unit for you.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.640
But from now on,

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:05.160
you're on your own.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.400
Thank you.

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:16.760
About Tong Shuang…

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.250
He was a good constable.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.450
[Wanted]

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.790
This is the house Zhuge Kongyun

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.750
tracked down.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.570
Miao Jie wouldn't have bought

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.400
such a rundown house
in these remote mountains for no reason.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.060
Something's definitely off.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.410
If Miao Jie had really raised Miao Yun

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.720
to become the second Yesha,

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.790
then the fewer people who knew,

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.640
the better.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.210
A house in such a remote place

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.070
would be ideal.

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.640
But

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.680
there's no village for miles.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:07.810
Who can we even ask?

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.580
Over there.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.920
Excuse me, sir.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.670
Secret Investigation Unit.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.750
[Secret Investigation Unit]

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.680
Officers,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:24.160
I'm just a physician.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.000
I've just come back from gathering herbs.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.640
Relax.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.770
We just want to ask you a few questions.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.420
Officers,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.580
go ahead and ask.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.460
I'll tell you everything I know.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.140
Sir,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.230
how long have you been
practicing medicine here?

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.840
I've been practicing medicine here

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:38.880
for over 10 years.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.710
So the villagers nearby

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:42.570
all come to you when they're sick?

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:44.750
Folks living in Mount Nan

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:45.790
are all poor,

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:47.950
and it's hard for them
to go downtown for treatment,

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.660
so I

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.030
settled down here.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.900
I usually

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.270
just treat small ailments

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.800
like headaches and fevers.

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.660
You're a true physician with a kind heart.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:57.380
You flatter me.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.510
It's just a physician's duty.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.180
Sir,

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.350
have you ever treated anyone
from this house?

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.510
This house has been abandoned

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.620
for over 10 years,

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.550
but I do

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.470
remember its owner.

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:13.950
What do you remember?

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.750
It was when I

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.820
first started practicing medicine here.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.620
It was pouring rain that day.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.510
The owner of this house

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.620
told me

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.900
that his son had a high fever
that wouldn't break

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.360
and asked me to take a look.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.230
My son has had a high fever for days.

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.230
He's unconscious

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.830
and rambling nonsense.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:35.900
Don't worry. Let me examine him.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.510
All right.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.140
There were only two people in that house.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.750
One glance at the boy,

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.660
and I never forgot him.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.820
Why?

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.750
Because that boy was very unusual.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.510
His entire body

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.900
was covered in scars

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.630
and all kinds of wounds,
both fresh and old.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.800
And he had a slight limp.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:31:57.540
Though just a child,

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:58.660
he looked like

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.340
an old soldier

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.140
who had just returned from battle.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.790
It gave me quite a shock.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:04.950
Sir,

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.790
do you still remember

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.190
what the boy looked like?

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.030
I can't recall his face,

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.340
but I do remember

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.620
that when I went,

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:14.470
he had been ill for a long time,

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.180
and his condition was very serious.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.550
I prescribed two doses of medicine,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.660
but they didn't help,

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.420
so I had no choice but to leave.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.900
Later,

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.420
when I wanted to check on him again,

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.340
they had already moved away.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.350
All right. Thank you for your help.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.340
Judging by the dust

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.710
in the house,

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.750
it's been at least a decade

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:42.900
since anyone entered.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:43.750
If what that physician said

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:44.750
is true,

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.140
Miao Jie must have taken Miao Yun away

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.100
for treatment.

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.550
But Miao Jie was
an Imperial Secretariat official.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.030
According to Zhuge Kongyun,

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.990
he lived alone in the capital,

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.270
even residing in the Imperial Secretariat.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:56.660
There's no way Miao Yun could have

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:57.750
stayed with him without being noticed.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.470
So

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:00.900
he hid Miao Yun somewhere?

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:02.710
The Imperial Secretariat officials

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:04.340
didn't know about Miao Yun's existence.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.580
Master and General Huo were both
in the capital,

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.380
and they also had adopted

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.340
Haiya orphans.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.180
If he had deliberately hidden Miao Yun,

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.180
it'd have aroused their suspicion.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.900
So how did he

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.710
conceal Miao Yun's existence

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.950
without drawing the attention of Mr. Zhong

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:19.420
and my father?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.580
A method that Minister Miao Jie

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.660
would use,

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.720
but Yesha wouldn't.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.380
You mean

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:31.750
the Cixin Orphanage?

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.010
[Cixin Orphanage]

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.070
I never knew

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.620
the Secret Investigation Unit
had female officers.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.080
It's for the convenience of investigation.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.820
The boy you're talking about, Miao Yun—

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.860
I remember him.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.580
Is he still here?

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:52.990
He left long ago.

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:55.070
Do you know where he went?

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.860
Children leaving the Cixin Orphanage

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.230
should have records.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.990
Regular children certainly do,

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.470
but Miao Yun

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:04.580
was an exception.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.179
To be honest,

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.949
when he arrived,

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:12.139
he was already mentally impaired.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:13.300
Mentally impaired?

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.620
We have a rule here—

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.389
never ask about a child's past.

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:19.030
As for who sent him here

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:20.949
or why he was mentally impaired,

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.070
nobody knows.

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:23.350
When he arrived,

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.100
he couldn't speak,

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:26.550
only smiled foolishly,

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.100
and often wandered off.

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:30.550
Shortly after, he disappeared.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.780
We sent people to look for him

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.179
but never found him.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.659
The matter

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.739
was eventually dropped.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:40.699
Do you remember what he looked like?

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.389
I do.

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.219
He had

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.070
scars all over his face and body

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.179
and a limp in his right leg.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.909
A truly pitiful boy.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.429
Could you draw

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:55.560
his portrait for us?

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.140
It's been so long,

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.700
but I'll try.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.560
So this is the second Yesha?

00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:10.180
This boy with an intellectual disability

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.780
is Miao Jie's successor?

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.260
The intellectual disability
might be a disguise,

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:15.830
a way to deceive others.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:17.580
After all, if he had been a normal child,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.550
Miao Jie would have had no excuse

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.990
to send him to the Cixin Orphanage.

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:21.510
Whether Miao Yun was
actually mentally impaired

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.640
isn't the point now.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.180
The point is—

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.470
where do we find him?

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:25.140
This is what he looked like

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.550
many years ago.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.300
People's looks change.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.700
Just one portrait

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.800
is far from enough.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.300
Besides, we can't be sure

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.470
if he's in the capital.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:34.140
Even if he is,

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:35.430
with the capital so large

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.620
and the few of us

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.780
hiding while searching,

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:39.180
there's not enough time.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.610
Father.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.260
What is it?

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:15.210
Regarding Chief Fang...

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.880
Regarding Fang Tianzheng's case,

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.580
I believe

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.830
there's more to it,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.830
so could you please

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.030
petition His Majesty

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.950
to postpone the execution?

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.950
His Majesty's word is law.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:30.220
How can it be changed so easily?

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.510
Besides,

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.580
the Chief of the Elite Constabulary Unit
turned traitor.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.910
It's such a shocking scandal.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.260
If we don't execute him quickly
to appease the public,

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.220
the imperial court will lose its dignity.

00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:42.100
But Father,

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.660
you know better than anyone

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.270
that Fang Tianzheng is cautious and timid.

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.390
Could something

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:48.660
have happened

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.140
to force him

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.780
into such an audacious act?

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.510
You've seen for yourself

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:00.070
how tight-lipped he is now.

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:01.910
I no longer care about

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.550
why he turned traitor.

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:06.390
It's a fact
that he released a key criminal.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.870
What we need to do

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:10.450
is capture Xiao Beiming
as soon as possible.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:12.870
But Father,

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.870
have you considered one possibility?

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.300
Are you trying to say

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.780
that Xiao Beiming might not be Yesha?

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.900
I've been thinking about it.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.830
Maybe Xiao Beiming

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.140
somehow

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.100
gained Fang Tianzheng's trust

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.350
and convinced him

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.780
he wasn't Yesha,

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.580
which is why Fang risked his life

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.700
to help clear his name.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.100
After all, the Fengbo Lake case

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.180
and the Huang Wuchang case

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.350
are full of holes.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.950
Full of holes?

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.030
What if there's

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.510
another possibility?

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:45.510
Maybe Xiao Beiming and Fang Tianzheng

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:47.570
were Yesha's accomplices all along.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.030
Their sinister ambitions

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.220
were discovered by Zhong Yunchi,

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:51.830
so they killed him
on Fengbo Lake to silence him.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:52.580
Then one fled,

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.870
and the other stayed
in the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:55.530
to continue their evil deeds.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.870
After Xiao Beiming was captured,

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.180
Fang Tianzheng went to great lengths

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.430
to release him,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.220
but his plot was exposed,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.030
and he was caught on the spot.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:07.510
Father,

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.180
d-don't you think that assumption

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.030
is too far-fetched?

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.300
You'd rather believe that a fugitive

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.700
might be wrongly accused

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:16.470
than trust

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.100
the evidence we've gathered.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.560
Whose theory sounds more far-fetched here?

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.070
At this point,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.660
I'll just speak my mind.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.220
Regarding the Yesha case,

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:29.830
your approach and judgment

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.220
have never convinced me.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.150
What did you say?

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.660
I still can't understand—

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.740
with so many

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.350
unanswered questions in the Yesha case,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.350
why are you so sure

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.100
that Xiao Beiming is the only suspect?

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.990
If he truly had such malicious intent,

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:42.470
wouldn't the King of Constables,

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.320
who was so close to him, have noticed?

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.950
Because Zhong Yunchi himself was

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:47.750
a hypocritical and cunning man!

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:49.830
The Elite Constabulary Unit

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.870
appears righteous and honorable,

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.030
but they're actually filthy
and corrupt inside,

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.220
treacherous and despicable!

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.300
I'm not surprised by any evil deeds

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.350
committed by the disciples

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:58.740
and subordinates trained

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.180
by such a person!

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:00.990
Father,

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.550
why are you

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.150
so prejudiced against them?

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.510
Because I became like this

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.910
all because of Zhong Yunchi!

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.000
You keep calling him King of Constables,

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.100
but do you really know him?

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220
Let me tell you—

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:24.510
I know Zhong Yunchi

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.180
better than anyone else.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.220
Because I was once

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.430
a constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit!
