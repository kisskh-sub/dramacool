01:47.667 --> 01:49.042
No!

01:53.667 --> 01:55.667
No!

02:05.667 --> 02:10.208
Yesterday, there was a shooting
in an abandoned market

02:10.292 --> 02:12.542
in the old town of Jiati.

02:12.625 --> 02:15.417
When the police arrived at the scene,

02:15.500 --> 02:18.917
they found an overturned car.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.083
- Hello, Kang!
- Three passengers were shot.

02:21.167 --> 02:23.500
Two are dead. One is missing.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.458
- Kang!
- Kang!

02:25.542 --> 02:28.375
- There were also many casualties.
- Kang, here is this month's money.

02:28.458 --> 02:29.708
It's all here.

02:32.958 --> 02:33.875
You can have this.

02:35.125 --> 02:35.958
Thank you, Kang!

02:36.042 --> 02:40.500
- The police say two foreigners are dead.
- Don't be useless tomorrow!

02:40.583 --> 02:41.917
- Okay.
- Thank you, Kang!

02:42.000 --> 02:43.083
...a mother and her daughter.

02:43.167 --> 02:48.250
The missing person is a male,
the husband and father of the deceased,

02:48.333 --> 02:50.417
named Bai An.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.125
Evidence indicated

02:52.208 --> 02:55.708
that Bai An is suspected to be
one of the main perpetrators of the crime.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.292
Hello, Kun Tai! Why aren't you here yet?

02:59.375 --> 03:00.833
I'm here with the money!

03:00.917 --> 03:07.292
- Another victim is named Kun Tai.
- Hello? Say something.

03:07.625 --> 03:09.917
He was 38 years old.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.833
Prior to his murder,

03:11.917 --> 03:17.000
Kun Tai had a history
of many violent crimes.

03:17.708 --> 03:20.208
And he was wanted by the police

03:20.292 --> 03:24.417
for intentional bodily injury
resulting in death.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.167
- His body was found at the crime scene.
- Why did you kill my wife and child?

03:29.250 --> 03:33.417
Kun Tai was found dead
from multiple gunshot wounds.

03:33.875 --> 03:37.000
- Let's move on to another drug case.
- You want to know why?

03:37.083 --> 03:38.208
Come with me.

03:59.125 --> 04:01.583
Hey! Stop grilling the fish!

04:01.667 --> 04:03.542
Grill the guy behind me!

04:03.625 --> 04:04.458
Okay, boss.

04:04.542 --> 04:05.458
Let's go.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.792
- Boss.
- Boss.

04:11.875 --> 04:12.750
It's nothing.

04:12.833 --> 04:13.750
Keep eating.

04:13.833 --> 04:15.125
Okay.

04:16.458 --> 04:19.625
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:33.708 --> 04:34.542
Why?

04:35.250 --> 04:36.917
Why my family?

04:37.500 --> 04:38.792
Guys,

04:38.875 --> 04:41.708
whoever kills this fucking man

04:42.458 --> 04:45.708
will get the money from Kun Tai.

04:46.542 --> 04:47.375
Come on!

05:02.583 --> 05:04.125
Everybody!

05:05.417 --> 05:06.542
Go!

06:00.292 --> 06:01.292
Why?

06:01.375 --> 06:03.208
Why did you kill my family?

06:03.292 --> 06:05.792
I was just getting paid

06:06.250 --> 06:07.917
to do what the boss ordered.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.042
He Yinghao is your boss?

06:12.167 --> 06:13.458
Where can I find him?

06:13.583 --> 06:15.167
I don't know.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.292
Okay!

06:18.125 --> 06:19.083
Okay.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.792
All I know is a driver.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.292
The driver of the boss.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.125
We met a couple of times.

06:26.542 --> 06:27.833
I heard from him

06:28.208 --> 06:30.833
that He Yinghao picks up his daughter

06:31.292 --> 06:34.208
from Jiati Middle School every day.

06:34.833 --> 06:36.125
Tell me the plate number!

06:36.667 --> 06:41.042
JIATI-6677.

07:15.833 --> 07:16.750
Mom!

07:38.458 --> 07:39.375
Miss.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.292
Does the international school
have a wrestling class?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.375
Your campus life is pretty exciting!

07:48.458 --> 07:49.708
It's none of your business.

07:52.833 --> 07:53.750
Where's my dad?

07:54.167 --> 07:55.250
He's busy.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.792
He's waiting for you at home.

07:56.875 --> 07:58.375
You don't like him, do you?

07:58.833 --> 08:00.792
You prefer that I come instead, don't you?

08:01.875 --> 08:03.083
You don't have to be here.

08:03.167 --> 08:04.708
I can go home on my own.

08:04.792 --> 08:06.708
Come. Please get in the car, princess.

08:07.625 --> 08:08.542
Suck-up.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.000
I'm sorry.

08:15.083 --> 08:15.958
Are you okay?

08:25.292 --> 08:26.708
Watch where you're going.

08:27.292 --> 08:28.333
Sorry.

08:35.625 --> 08:36.667
Let's go!

09:01.375 --> 09:03.542
- Tingting, you are back.
- Principal, I'm sorry.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.208
- Sit down and eat dinner.
- I've failed to discipline her.

09:07.125 --> 09:07.958
Don't worry.

09:07.958 --> 09:10.750
We will definitely continue
to support you next year.

09:11.167 --> 09:12.125
Sorry.

09:20.417 --> 09:21.792
Put your chopsticks down.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.250
We have rules for eating.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.500
Look at your clothes.

09:29.625 --> 09:30.667
Go get changed.

09:30.708 --> 09:31.875
Tingting, I'll go too.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.375
Let her go by herself.

09:45.583 --> 09:46.625
Yinghao,

09:46.958 --> 09:49.458
there's a problem
in the company's logistics department.

09:49.542 --> 09:51.125
The police received a tip-off

09:51.208 --> 09:53.167
and found drugs in our shipments.

09:53.750 --> 09:54.917
How could that be?

09:55.833 --> 09:57.917
Drug crimes
have always been rampant in Jiati.

09:58.625 --> 10:00.292
I suspect that some of our employees

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
are secretly working with drug dealers.

10:04.583 --> 10:07.417
I have always been responsible
for security checks.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.958
Are you saying I am the problem?

10:10.542 --> 10:11.958
I didn't say that.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.708
But we can't say the same

10:14.708 --> 10:16.208
about the local staff.

10:18.458 --> 10:19.750
I'll find out.

10:21.917 --> 10:22.833
Lu Ping,

10:23.958 --> 10:25.833
if word of the drugs gets out,

10:25.917 --> 10:28.167
local authorities
will be under a lot of pressure.

10:28.250 --> 10:30.875
Then our company being exempt
from logistics inspections

10:30.958 --> 10:32.167
will be a big problem.

10:32.667 --> 10:33.833
Take care of it.

10:33.958 --> 10:34.875
Okay.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.000
Mr. He, I think our company--

10:38.083 --> 10:38.917
Tingting.

10:45.500 --> 10:46.958
What happened at school?

10:47.708 --> 10:48.667
Nothing happened.

10:49.958 --> 10:50.875
Nothing?

10:52.167 --> 10:54.042
What happened to your clothes?

10:59.583 --> 11:00.708
I just spilled paint.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.042
Is it that simple?

11:05.417 --> 11:06.458
That's it.

11:09.042 --> 11:12.125
Then why did the principal call me

11:12.958 --> 11:16.208
and beg me not to withdraw my donations?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.583
How would I know?

11:17.583 --> 11:20.125
The principal doesn't
tell me what he does.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.875
Yinghao, is there a misunderstanding?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.500
What misunderstanding?

11:25.208 --> 11:27.125
The principal has contacted me!

11:27.625 --> 11:28.625
You're still lying!

11:29.250 --> 11:30.917
They provoked me first!

11:31.375 --> 11:33.083
How are you behaving as a student?

11:34.292 --> 11:35.458
Fighting?

11:35.583 --> 11:37.125
Who taught you that?

11:37.417 --> 11:40.208
You taught me to bravely fight back

11:40.375 --> 11:41.792
against bullying and injustice.

11:43.458 --> 11:45.500
As for fighting, I learned it from him.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.292
Well, it's not as safe here
as it is in China.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.667
Girls should know some self-defense.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.667
I told you to fight back,

11:56.125 --> 11:57.500
not to cause trouble.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.917
How dare you threaten the principal!

12:00.500 --> 12:02.917
Do you know how much I pay
for you to study here?

12:03.250 --> 12:04.875
You know nothing.

12:08.042 --> 12:10.417
I don't care if your dad is He Yinghao.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.750
I'm still the boss
in this school, you know?

12:13.458 --> 12:16.708
He favors the local students.
He doesn't care who is at fault.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.708
You are being really pushy
in the classroom,

12:20.792 --> 12:22.083
getting physical,

12:22.167 --> 12:24.625
and you even brought weapons!

12:24.708 --> 12:27.500
Just because your dad is He Yinghao

12:27.583 --> 12:30.667
doesn't mean you can break the rules!

12:30.750 --> 12:31.833
You should know

12:31.917 --> 12:35.250
I can kick you out right now!

12:35.333 --> 12:38.125
I don't like the school or Jiati!
I don't want to live here!

12:38.208 --> 12:40.208
This is your home.
Where are you going to go?

12:40.292 --> 12:43.042
This is not my home.
Home is where my mom is!

12:45.125 --> 12:46.417
I hate this place.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.333
I hate you, too.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.208
Don't pretend to be a good father.

12:49.292 --> 12:50.750
You are getting out of hand!

12:51.667 --> 12:52.958
Am I?

12:53.042 --> 12:56.042
Since I walked in, have you even asked me
why I got into a fight?

12:57.083 --> 12:57.958
No!

12:58.042 --> 13:00.417
Lu Ping is a vegetarian.
Have you ever cared?

13:00.500 --> 13:01.458
No!

13:02.375 --> 13:05.917
Did you keep your promise to go with me
to the temple today to pray for my mom?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.375
Also no!

13:07.458 --> 13:10.750
You don't care about anyone
but yourself and your business!

13:10.833 --> 13:11.875
Tingting, stop it.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.292
You don't give a damn
about what others really need.

13:14.708 --> 13:17.083
In your eyes,
everything can be solved with money!

13:25.542 --> 13:27.833
Yinghao, keep your cool.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.958
Tingting has grown up now.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.083
Don't always scold her like this.

13:43.667 --> 13:44.500
Lu Ping,

13:46.000 --> 13:48.167
book the earliest flight tomorrow for me.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.167
I'm going to go back to visit her mom.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.250
Yinghao,

13:53.625 --> 13:56.333
someone needs to stay in Jiati
to keep an eye on the business.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.042
If you're not here,

13:58.333 --> 13:59.583
I'm afraid...

14:24.083 --> 14:25.542
No!

14:28.458 --> 14:30.958
Baby!

14:35.917 --> 14:38.500
No!

14:46.083 --> 14:48.292
He Yinghao!

14:57.208 --> 14:58.542
Wow!

15:01.375 --> 15:02.958
All our goods

15:03.583 --> 15:05.208
are gone.

15:07.708 --> 15:10.542
They were seized by the police.

15:12.208 --> 15:15.042
It was done by the wanted man
in the news named Bai An.

15:15.625 --> 15:16.917
He broke in

15:17.500 --> 15:19.042
and killed all our guys.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.833
I think he called the police.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.042
Long!

15:34.625 --> 15:35.458
Long!

15:36.333 --> 15:37.167
Long!

15:40.917 --> 15:42.500
You lost the goods.

15:43.250 --> 15:44.542
You know what happens next.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.500
Spare my life.

15:46.583 --> 15:47.542
I'll pay for it.

15:48.042 --> 15:49.292
I'll pay for everything.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.083
Is your life

15:52.083 --> 15:53.583
worth 20 million dollars?

15:58.375 --> 15:59.208
Long!

16:00.000 --> 16:00.833
Long!

16:02.417 --> 16:03.750
Long!

16:33.250 --> 16:34.250
Where are my goods?

16:35.333 --> 16:37.542
There is an issue

16:37.625 --> 16:39.208
in He Group's logistics chain.

16:39.292 --> 16:42.042
The police have seized all of our goods.

16:42.792 --> 16:44.042
Where's that punk Kun Tai?

16:44.417 --> 16:47.125
What do I need him for
if he can't look after the goods?

16:47.208 --> 16:49.250
Listen, Long Tali,
if my dad hadn't insisted

16:49.333 --> 16:51.583
that I keep you as a dog,

16:51.667 --> 16:52.583
I wouldn't have--

16:55.500 --> 16:57.542
Talk to He Yinghao tomorrow.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.833
Find Bai An.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.375
Tingting, come.

17:23.917 --> 17:24.708
Tingting!

17:43.042 --> 17:44.667
My little girl has grown up.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.583
What you said last night

17:48.625 --> 17:49.625
was amazing.

17:53.833 --> 17:56.333
We're going back to see your mom today.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.708
Your mom would be so happy

18:01.542 --> 18:02.833
to see who you've become.

18:03.625 --> 18:04.583
Yinghao,

18:04.667 --> 18:06.042
we have news from the police.

18:15.167 --> 18:16.000
What is it?

18:16.750 --> 18:19.792
The police examined the drugs
from the logistics warehouse.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.542
The test results showed
that these drugs are identical

18:22.542 --> 18:24.417
to the batch from three years ago.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.250
After we negotiated
with the police in private,

18:27.333 --> 18:29.417
the matter will not
be made public for now.

18:35.333 --> 18:36.500
While I'm not here,

18:37.250 --> 18:40.458
visit the leaders on my behalf

18:40.542 --> 18:41.958
to express my gratitude.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.875
Spare no expense.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.292
Okay.

19:57.958 --> 19:58.833
Tingting,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.708
your dad isn't good at showing it,

20:02.542 --> 20:03.958
but he does care about you.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.625
Did my dad tell you to say that?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.833
You probably don't know

20:09.917 --> 20:12.208
why he values Lu Ping so much, do you?

20:18.125 --> 20:19.417
His greatest worry

20:19.500 --> 20:22.792
is that you'll grow up
without a mother's love.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.875
Wu, can't you ever learn to shut up?

20:33.208 --> 20:35.042
The police have identified Bai An

20:35.125 --> 20:37.208
as a preliminary suspect in the shooting.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.083
Do you know how to drive? Pay me!

20:47.167 --> 20:48.167
You blocked my way!

21:05.042 --> 21:06.375
That's them! Let's go!

21:06.833 --> 21:08.000
Reverse the car!

21:08.083 --> 21:08.958
Get down!

21:27.500 --> 21:28.333
Help!

21:28.417 --> 21:29.333
Let me go!

21:39.375 --> 21:40.292
Are you okay?

21:52.625 --> 21:53.667
I want them alive!

22:06.833 --> 22:07.667
Get out!

22:07.750 --> 22:09.500
What? What's going on?

22:09.583 --> 22:10.417
Stay still!

22:10.500 --> 22:12.583
Tingting! Tingting!

22:15.250 --> 22:16.958
We need to have a talk.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.583
Tingting!

22:19.667 --> 22:21.125
Don't hurt Tingting!

22:21.208 --> 22:22.042
Wu Zheng!

22:22.625 --> 22:23.875
Save Tingting!

22:24.750 --> 22:25.708
Mr. He!

22:26.125 --> 22:26.875
Dad!

22:26.958 --> 22:28.000
- Get out!
- Let me go!

22:32.625 --> 22:34.708
Useless bunch.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.208
Let me go!

22:45.500 --> 22:46.375
Let me go!

23:10.750 --> 23:12.417
Take Tingting away first! Hurry!

23:12.500 --> 23:13.875
- Okay!
- Let's go.

23:25.625 --> 23:26.458
Let's go!

24:02.042 --> 24:02.958
Mr. He!

24:03.042 --> 24:03.917
Where's Tingting?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.250
She is all right.

24:50.792 --> 24:51.750
- Go!
- Go!

25:32.917 --> 25:33.917
Get them!

25:41.458 --> 25:42.667
Let me go!

26:08.833 --> 26:09.792
Wu Zheng!

26:21.375 --> 26:22.625
- I've got her!
- Let me go!

26:27.917 --> 26:29.208
Follow me or die here.

26:37.875 --> 26:39.375
Get in the car!

26:40.500 --> 26:41.625
Go!

27:44.208 --> 27:49.333
- No drugs in Jiati!
- No drugs in Jiati!

27:49.417 --> 27:54.500
- No drugs in Jiati!
- No drugs in Jiati!

27:55.042 --> 27:56.750
Parades are useless.

27:56.833 --> 27:58.125
The only way is

27:58.208 --> 28:01.667
to thoroughly eradicate
these drug dealers,

28:02.208 --> 28:04.625
especially the evil forces led by Clay.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.500
He has become

28:06.583 --> 28:09.292
the biggest tumor in Jiati!

28:10.375 --> 28:11.542
Congressman,

28:12.125 --> 28:14.458
every time you call me names on TV,

28:15.500 --> 28:17.875
I get really annoyed.

28:20.625 --> 28:23.083
That's why I came to visit you today

28:23.167 --> 28:24.208
and brought you a gift.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.292
Enjoy as much as you like,

28:26.458 --> 28:27.708
free of charge!

28:31.375 --> 28:33.667
You're just intent on
disrespecting me, aren't you?

28:37.542 --> 28:38.542
Children,

28:38.917 --> 28:40.000
don't worry.

28:42.083 --> 28:43.458
- Mom!
- Mom!

28:43.667 --> 28:44.750
Lan!

28:44.875 --> 28:45.708
Mom!

28:45.708 --> 28:46.708
Lan!

28:46.708 --> 28:48.125
- Mom!
- Mom!

28:48.292 --> 28:49.292
- Lan!
- Mom!

28:49.375 --> 28:50.417
Mom!

28:51.250 --> 28:52.708
- Mom!
- Mom!

28:56.875 --> 28:58.625
What's with you?

28:58.708 --> 29:00.375
You should've done this earlier.

29:06.000 --> 29:06.875
Mr. Clay.

29:07.625 --> 29:08.542
Mr. Clay.

29:10.042 --> 29:10.875
Mr. Clay.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.125
Fuck off!

29:12.417 --> 29:14.917
Please! Please let my sons go.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.417
I can do anything for you!

29:16.958 --> 29:18.000
Mr. Clay.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.375
Let's play a game.

29:26.208 --> 29:27.542
Only one of them

29:28.375 --> 29:29.625
can survive.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.958
Who dies? Who lives?

29:36.750 --> 29:37.917
You decide.

29:40.917 --> 29:44.208
Or they both die.

30:07.208 --> 30:08.708
Xiaodi,

30:09.458 --> 30:11.083
sorry!

30:12.125 --> 30:14.750
You're the older brother.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.125
- Xiaoda!
- Da!

30:29.208 --> 30:30.375
- Xiaoda!
- Da!

30:30.458 --> 30:32.250
This is your father,

30:32.333 --> 30:33.958
a man who speaks of moral virtues

30:34.083 --> 30:36.250
but would shoot his own son!

30:36.333 --> 30:38.333
Go to hell!

30:42.542 --> 30:43.792
Send him to swallow drugs

30:44.542 --> 30:45.750
and be a drug mule!

30:50.208 --> 30:52.542
Boss, Mr. He has arrived.

30:58.708 --> 31:00.042
Chairman He Yinghao!

31:01.083 --> 31:02.750
I hope you don't mind

31:03.542 --> 31:04.917
the way I invited you here.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.250
You brought me here

31:08.083 --> 31:10.458
because of the drugs, didn't you?

31:10.542 --> 31:11.708
More than that.

31:12.083 --> 31:13.958
I have another big gift for you.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.333
These are logistics companies
local to Jiati.

31:18.042 --> 31:19.208
Just sign

31:19.625 --> 31:20.875
and they will be yours.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.875
As for the 20 million US dollars,

31:23.958 --> 31:26.542
I can write it off

31:28.083 --> 31:29.708
as long as we work together.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.042
Isn't this the big gift

31:32.125 --> 31:34.208
that you've been dreaming of?

31:35.667 --> 31:36.958
In Jiati,

31:37.042 --> 31:39.042
only my company is exempt from inspection.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.250
That must be what appeals to you.

31:41.792 --> 31:42.625
Right?

31:45.250 --> 31:46.375
I won't sign it

31:48.000 --> 31:49.417
even if you kill me.

31:56.667 --> 31:57.542
Mr. He,

31:59.750 --> 32:01.375
you are more useful to me alive.

32:02.458 --> 32:03.708
If you are dead,

32:04.458 --> 32:06.167
He Group

32:06.833 --> 32:08.458
would be of no value to me.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.625
But your daughter is different.

32:13.458 --> 32:14.208
Son of a bitch!

32:14.208 --> 32:15.875
Don't hurt my daughter!

32:35.917 --> 32:37.500
I've seen you

32:37.958 --> 32:39.333
outside the school entrance.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.667
You...

32:43.583 --> 32:44.833
You're the wanted man!

32:44.833 --> 32:47.792
The police have identified Bai An
as a preliminary suspect.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.375
You killed your wife and daughter!

32:49.375 --> 32:50.708
Shut up!

32:52.542 --> 32:54.875
Your dad is the man who killed them!

33:02.208 --> 33:03.667
That's not gonna happen!

33:07.417 --> 33:09.667
You know nothing
about your family, huh?

33:13.042 --> 33:14.375
I won't trust a wanted man.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.542
Without me, you would already be dead.

33:24.375 --> 33:26.250
This is not your business.

33:26.917 --> 33:28.125
Get out of here.

33:30.333 --> 33:31.792
Go!

33:33.875 --> 33:35.250
Thank you.

33:35.250 --> 33:36.458
You saved me.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.708
Wu Zheng, what the hell is going on?

33:48.083 --> 33:50.167
Hold the questions for now. Listen to me.

33:50.792 --> 33:52.708
Did Tingting call you or come back?

33:52.708 --> 33:53.833
No.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.792
What happened?

33:56.750 --> 33:59.542
It's likely a retaliation
by the drug cartel.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.125
Mr. He was taken.

34:02.917 --> 34:05.667
All the others are dead.

34:06.917 --> 34:07.917
What about Tingting?

34:09.958 --> 34:11.542
Wu Zheng, are you fucking useless?

34:11.625 --> 34:14.667
Keeping them safe was your only job,
but you failed to protect them!

34:15.375 --> 34:16.917
Shut up now.

34:17.500 --> 34:18.750
I lost them,

34:18.833 --> 34:20.625
but I'll risk my life to get them back.

34:20.958 --> 34:24.042
Get the security camera footage
from yesterday afternoon

34:24.542 --> 34:26.417
outside the Jiati school.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.125
I stopped a man wearing a hat.

34:29.417 --> 34:30.667
Who is that guy?

34:30.667 --> 34:32.167
Don't worry about it.

34:33.125 --> 34:34.625
Just send me the video quickly.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.958
Wu Zheng, listen. Don't mess around.
The police have already come by.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.125
Besides your captain,

34:48.875 --> 34:51.625
who else knew the route they were taking?

34:52.042 --> 34:53.125
Only the captain knew.

34:53.667 --> 34:56.000
He only told us right before we set out.

35:10.458 --> 35:12.500
Lu Ping, this is He Ting!

35:12.792 --> 35:13.667
Tingting!

35:14.042 --> 35:15.542
Tingting, where are you?

35:15.542 --> 35:17.125
How are you? Are you okay?

35:17.125 --> 35:18.167
I'm fine.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.208
I don't know where I am.

35:21.500 --> 35:22.417
Okay.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.042
Listen to me.

35:25.708 --> 35:27.083
From now on,

35:27.083 --> 35:28.625
don't trust anyone.

35:29.375 --> 35:32.208
That includes Wu Zheng, right?

35:32.542 --> 35:34.042
I'm not quite sure now either.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.542
But before you all left,

35:36.542 --> 35:38.500
no one knew the route except for him.

35:39.292 --> 35:40.500
Tingting,

35:40.500 --> 35:42.875
you need to find a safe place to hide.

35:43.250 --> 35:44.833
I'm coming to pick you up right now.

35:45.083 --> 35:45.958
Got it?

35:46.292 --> 35:47.500
I've got it.

36:16.458 --> 36:17.417
Help!

36:17.875 --> 36:18.875
Help!

36:23.125 --> 36:24.125
Are you Chinese?

36:24.208 --> 36:25.708
I'm He Yinghao's daughter.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.625
I was kidnapped. I just escaped.

36:28.083 --> 36:29.292
He Yinghao's daughter?

36:29.458 --> 36:30.500
You're safe now.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.292
I'll take you
to the police station. Let's go.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.500
I just called my family.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.167
They're coming to pick me up.

36:37.167 --> 36:40.333
Don't worry. I'll call your family
as soon as we get to the station.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.292
Let's go.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.917
Be careful.

36:57.167 --> 36:58.375
Hello, sir.

36:58.375 --> 37:01.000
I am patrol officer PDJ-663.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.833
That's He Group's chairman's daughter!

37:08.042 --> 37:08.958
That's great!

37:08.958 --> 37:10.167
We got a call.

37:10.167 --> 37:12.125
All officers are looking for her.

37:12.125 --> 37:13.500
I have it under control.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.083
Don't worry. You can go back.

37:15.417 --> 37:16.250
Yes, sir!

37:18.250 --> 37:19.250
Headquarters.

37:23.417 --> 37:24.417
Freeze!

37:25.875 --> 37:27.167
You can't escape.

37:27.333 --> 37:29.375
You're worth one million US dollars!

37:30.708 --> 37:31.625
Hey.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.583
I only need answers!

37:37.542 --> 37:38.667
Who sent you?

37:39.292 --> 37:41.000
Someone offered a reward.

37:41.083 --> 37:44.208
The whole underground knows
she's worth one million US dollars!

37:44.292 --> 37:46.333
But I don't know who paid for it.

37:46.417 --> 37:47.667
How did you find me?

37:49.708 --> 37:51.208
I tracked your phone call

37:51.292 --> 37:52.583
and found you!

37:59.667 --> 38:00.583
He's dead?

38:00.583 --> 38:01.750
Just passed out.

38:01.750 --> 38:02.750
Let's go.

38:21.458 --> 38:22.958
Why were you there?

38:30.625 --> 38:32.458
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

38:33.750 --> 38:35.083
Have you been spying on me

38:35.833 --> 38:37.833
ever since we met outside the school?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.625
I don't know who to trust anymore.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.083
The kidnappers were prepared.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.292
But only Wu Zheng knew the route.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.083
And there's Lu Ping.

38:59.542 --> 39:01.500
She was the only one I contacted tonight.

39:05.208 --> 39:06.667
We can work together.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.667
Eat it and then we can go.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.458
Don't you want revenge?

39:16.708 --> 39:18.583
But you don't even know where my dad is.

39:18.833 --> 39:20.083
I will track him down.

39:20.083 --> 39:22.125
Then why don't you just ask me?

39:24.625 --> 39:25.708
What's your point?

39:26.625 --> 39:27.875
I want to find him too.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.542
And in that, we share the same goal.

39:30.958 --> 39:32.792
So why can't we work together?

39:33.458 --> 39:36.083
You should understand what that means.

39:38.333 --> 39:39.167
I know.

39:41.250 --> 39:42.708
I'm sure you'll need me.

39:43.542 --> 39:44.875
But you have to keep me safe.

39:46.167 --> 39:48.667
As for what happens
after we find him, that's for later.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.708
Even if I want to kill him?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
Why?

39:57.542 --> 39:59.208
Drugs killed my mom.

40:00.208 --> 40:02.167
My dad and I hate drugs
more than anything.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.083
I'm sure

40:04.542 --> 40:06.542
my dad wasn't the man
who killed your family.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.750
And I'm sure
you won't kill indiscriminately

40:10.250 --> 40:11.667
or you wouldn't have saved me

40:12.500 --> 40:13.333
twice.

40:16.875 --> 40:18.792
You are nothing but a problem.

40:21.375 --> 40:23.375
No, I'm not a problem.

40:24.333 --> 40:26.375
I'm the only lead you have right now.

40:54.083 --> 40:55.875
I found the guy you mentioned.
His name is Bai An.

40:55.875 --> 40:58.333
He's a wanted man.
Did he kidnap Tingting?

41:02.208 --> 41:03.125
Not him.

41:05.833 --> 41:06.792
Listen up.

41:07.417 --> 41:08.833
From now on,

41:09.667 --> 41:12.875
if He Ting contacts you,
tell me right away.

41:14.542 --> 41:15.667
Or else,

41:15.958 --> 41:17.500
you'll get her killed.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.458
What do you mean?

41:19.458 --> 41:21.125
I'm on my way to pick up Tingting.

41:21.125 --> 41:23.083
I didn't have time to tell you.

41:23.375 --> 41:24.417
You don't have to come.

41:25.708 --> 41:27.042
She's not here anymore.

41:42.792 --> 41:45.000
I think it has to do with drugs.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.417
Before departing, I heard my dad talking.

41:47.792 --> 41:50.250
My dad fired a bunch of guys
in the company three years ago

41:50.250 --> 41:51.625
for smuggling drugs.

41:51.833 --> 41:55.042
The police examined the drugs
from the logistics warehouse.

41:55.042 --> 41:57.708
The test results showed
that these drugs are identical

41:57.708 --> 41:59.250
to the batch from three years ago.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.167
I heard they're all out of jail.

42:01.167 --> 42:02.750
Now they are a group of outlaws.

42:02.750 --> 42:04.250
They'll do anything for money.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.333
This is the logistics depot
where they worked.

42:07.042 --> 42:10.042
There should still be a file on them
on the supervisor's computer.

42:10.500 --> 42:11.792
Are you sure

42:12.208 --> 42:13.917
they are the abductors?

42:14.417 --> 42:17.167
They probably know something at least.

42:17.167 --> 42:19.625
I'll go in and distract the guard.
Come in later.

42:27.625 --> 42:29.167
Help! Help me!

42:29.542 --> 42:30.625
Help me.

42:30.625 --> 42:31.583
What happened?

42:31.583 --> 42:32.958
I'm He Yinghao's daughter.

42:32.958 --> 42:34.542
I ran away from kidnappers.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.208
Come in quickly!

42:43.792 --> 42:47.292
According to the latest news
from the police, two bodies were found.

42:47.292 --> 42:49.667
One was a Jiati patrol officer,

42:49.667 --> 42:53.542
while the other was a murderer
posing as a police officer.

42:53.542 --> 42:56.958
There was no sign
of the kidnapped girl from the He family.

42:56.958 --> 42:59.042
Other details of the case

42:59.042 --> 43:01.000
were not immediately available.

43:02.708 --> 43:03.708
Ms. He Ting,

43:04.375 --> 43:06.875
how did you escape from the kidnappers?

43:08.000 --> 43:09.458
I'll introduce you to him.

43:12.750 --> 43:13.583
Who is it?

43:13.583 --> 43:14.750
Do you want to die?

43:23.458 --> 43:24.833
This betel nut guy

43:24.917 --> 43:27.083
is the ringleader of the fired employees.

43:27.167 --> 43:29.000
I remember his nickname very well.

43:29.958 --> 43:30.958
They were in touch.

43:36.792 --> 43:37.708
Tell me.

43:37.708 --> 43:39.250
Where can I find him?

43:39.625 --> 43:41.000
I don't understand what he is saying.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.750
Where can we find the betel nut guy?

43:43.250 --> 43:44.583
Lese Slum Market.

43:44.583 --> 43:47.542
It is a shady place.
Even the police avoid going there.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.458
You'll get yourselves killed there.

43:54.375 --> 43:56.125
You'll be like the phone

43:56.375 --> 43:58.417
if you let anyone else know.

44:00.083 --> 44:02.167
What did he say?

44:03.542 --> 44:05.042
I don't understand!

44:15.583 --> 44:17.583
The bag must be your treasure.

44:18.292 --> 44:19.292
Of course.

44:20.167 --> 44:22.292
This is a birthday gift my mom gave me.

44:23.958 --> 44:25.667
Although the color is a bit tacky,

44:25.667 --> 44:27.083
I'll keep using it.

44:28.167 --> 44:29.958
Don't girls like pink?

44:30.042 --> 44:31.250
That's a stereotype.

44:31.708 --> 44:33.292
Do all girls have to like pink?

44:34.458 --> 44:36.667
Come on, it's out of fashion, okay?

44:36.750 --> 44:40.000
When have you adults
ever really cared about others?

44:41.417 --> 44:43.083
Happy birthday!

44:43.875 --> 44:45.167
I love you, Dad!

44:45.583 --> 44:47.833
I finally get my own phone!

44:52.167 --> 44:53.417
No way, Dad.

44:53.417 --> 44:55.167
Dreadful neon pink?

44:55.333 --> 44:57.833
My classmates will laugh at me.

45:42.833 --> 45:43.917
Boom!

45:44.125 --> 45:45.875
They're the other guys we're looking for.

45:46.208 --> 45:47.208
Pay up!

45:47.250 --> 45:48.333
I will go in alone.

45:48.333 --> 45:49.833
And you stay here.

45:51.000 --> 45:51.833
Wait.

45:52.292 --> 45:54.125
These guys are low-level drug dealers

45:54.208 --> 45:55.708
and naturally timid and cautious.

45:56.458 --> 45:57.875
At the slightest sign of danger,

45:57.875 --> 46:00.000
they will take off and disappear,

46:00.000 --> 46:01.500
making it harder to find them.

46:01.958 --> 46:03.208
It's better for me to go.

46:03.250 --> 46:04.375
They should recognize me.

46:04.375 --> 46:05.542
I'm no threat to them.

46:05.542 --> 46:06.667
No.

46:06.667 --> 46:07.708
Don't do that.

46:07.708 --> 46:08.875
It's too dangerous.

46:09.417 --> 46:11.333
You've got me covered, right?

46:25.375 --> 46:26.333
Baldy,

46:27.125 --> 46:28.500
take me to the betel nut guy.

46:28.583 --> 46:30.833
Who are you, kid? Get out of here!

46:37.375 --> 46:38.875
I'm He Yinghao's daughter.

46:39.333 --> 46:40.958
I'm worth one million US dollars.

46:41.458 --> 46:43.167
Boss, it's really her.

46:49.833 --> 46:50.792
Come with me.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.375
Let's go.

47:18.917 --> 47:20.375
What are you looking at?

47:37.792 --> 47:38.583
Get moving!

47:38.583 --> 47:40.542
Drag him out and cut his belly open

47:40.542 --> 47:42.292
to try to save the drugs

47:42.417 --> 47:44.167
before they turn to shit!

48:05.375 --> 48:06.250
Stop!

48:12.333 --> 48:13.333
Don't touch me.

48:13.792 --> 48:14.875
Let her in.

48:24.750 --> 48:25.500
Give it back!

48:25.500 --> 48:27.042
You can't bring this in.

48:27.042 --> 48:28.542
You'll get it back when you come out.

48:36.667 --> 48:39.292
You're really He Yinghao's daughter.

48:39.375 --> 48:40.375
Girl,

48:41.083 --> 48:42.708
what do you want

48:43.167 --> 48:44.458
from me?

48:47.458 --> 48:48.417
I'm here

48:49.125 --> 48:50.708
to make a deal with you.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.875
I want to hire you to help save my dad.

48:56.917 --> 48:58.708
Why should I help you?

48:59.958 --> 49:01.833
Do you know that your dad fired me

49:02.292 --> 49:04.125
and put me in jail?

49:06.208 --> 49:09.583
I'll give you two million US dollars
if you help me.

49:15.542 --> 49:16.375
Wait.

49:37.792 --> 49:39.042
Where the hell is Bai An?

49:39.583 --> 49:41.333
I really don't know.

49:41.958 --> 49:43.875
We were just colleagues.

49:44.625 --> 49:46.542
After his family was Killed,

49:46.625 --> 49:48.583
he suddenly disappeared.

50:03.333 --> 50:04.792
Hello, boss.

50:04.875 --> 50:05.917
She has been found.

50:06.333 --> 50:07.500
She's near you.

50:08.458 --> 50:10.208
The man who took your dad

50:10.292 --> 50:11.667
is Clay.

50:12.458 --> 50:16.375
He is a real big shot, a major drug lord!

50:17.250 --> 50:18.917
Do you want me to go against him

50:19.000 --> 50:20.875
for only two million dollars?

50:25.250 --> 50:27.042
Actually, your dad

50:27.500 --> 50:29.875
should know more about Clay than I do.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.917
Over the past three years,

50:32.000 --> 50:35.375
Clay's goods have been transported

50:35.458 --> 50:36.917
using your logistics channels.

50:37.000 --> 50:37.833
Impossible!

50:39.000 --> 50:41.042
How could my dad be involved
with a drug lord?

50:46.833 --> 50:48.042
Well, I won't trouble you.

50:48.792 --> 50:50.333
As long as you get me home safely,

50:50.542 --> 50:51.958
the two million dollars is yours.

50:53.333 --> 50:55.000
I don't need two million dollars.

50:55.500 --> 50:56.875
If I just capture you,

50:56.958 --> 50:59.750
your family will pay me as much as I want!

50:59.875 --> 51:01.292
After I get the money,

51:01.292 --> 51:02.750
I'll give you to Clay.

51:04.292 --> 51:06.708
You're like a cash machine
that walked right up to us!

51:18.292 --> 51:19.375
Stay back!

51:19.625 --> 51:21.000
Bastard!

51:24.042 --> 51:25.083
Get her!

51:25.875 --> 51:26.917
Let me go!

51:27.417 --> 51:28.500
Go to hell!

51:28.500 --> 51:30.583
Do you know
how much these drugs are worth?

51:30.583 --> 51:31.917
Which hand threw it?

51:31.917 --> 51:32.958
Hold her down

51:32.958 --> 51:34.750
and cut it off right now!

51:34.875 --> 51:36.833
Aren't you afraid Clay will kill you?

51:37.167 --> 51:38.167
Of course I'm afraid.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.083
But I'm more afraid of losing money!

51:41.292 --> 51:42.958
There's always a next life.

51:42.958 --> 51:45.292
In this life, no one can stop me
from making money!

51:45.500 --> 51:46.375
Fuck!

51:55.667 --> 51:56.542
Bai An!

52:06.333 --> 52:07.250
Are you okay?

52:25.500 --> 52:26.417
Shit!

52:26.500 --> 52:27.458
Stay back.

52:27.542 --> 52:28.833
Stay back or I'll kill her!

52:37.542 --> 52:39.542
You're lucky it worked this time.

52:39.708 --> 52:42.208
Next time, kick them between the legs.

52:42.208 --> 52:43.833
Don't bite. Okay?

52:47.167 --> 52:48.583
Where can I find Clay?

52:49.333 --> 52:50.167
I'll tell you.

52:50.958 --> 52:52.042
Outside of town,

52:52.042 --> 52:54.083
Clay has a drug base.

52:54.250 --> 52:55.833
Your dad should be there.

52:56.042 --> 52:57.458
The base is closed off.

52:57.458 --> 52:59.625
Only a delivery guy called Mr. Jiu

52:59.625 --> 53:01.167
can come and go as he pleases.

53:01.417 --> 53:03.583
He's one of Clay's trusted men.

53:03.917 --> 53:05.125
Outside of town

53:05.125 --> 53:07.625
is the old Jiati Motel.

53:07.625 --> 53:08.917
That's his turf.

53:08.917 --> 53:11.500
You're going to die if you go there.

53:54.292 --> 53:56.250
Go! Let's go!

54:59.375 --> 55:00.250
Go!

55:16.750 --> 55:17.625
Jump!

55:17.708 --> 55:19.750
I can't! I'm not Tony Jaa!

55:19.833 --> 55:20.792
Stop there!

55:25.625 --> 55:26.875
Keep running!

55:28.417 --> 55:29.375
Kill him!

56:19.042 --> 56:20.292
Give her to me.

56:21.042 --> 56:22.375
I'll leave you in one piece.

57:14.292 --> 57:15.542
Good!

57:22.750 --> 57:24.250
I like it!

57:25.875 --> 57:26.917
What a pity.

57:27.583 --> 57:29.542
You ruined my makeup!

57:53.083 --> 57:53.917
Bai An!

57:56.375 --> 57:57.208
Go!

58:05.667 --> 58:06.500
Bai An!

58:08.875 --> 58:09.792
Go!

58:32.125 --> 58:32.917
Stop!

58:32.917 --> 58:34.125
Stop right there!

58:36.417 --> 58:37.583
Let me go!

58:38.333 --> 58:39.125
Let me go!

58:45.792 --> 58:46.917
Tingting, come here!

58:48.667 --> 58:49.500
Tingting,

58:50.083 --> 58:50.958
what are you doing?

58:52.000 --> 58:53.542
From now on,

58:53.625 --> 58:55.292
don't trust anyone.

58:57.042 --> 58:57.917
Tingting!

58:58.000 --> 58:58.833
He Ting!

58:59.583 --> 59:00.583
Tingting!

59:01.542 --> 59:03.667
Tingting, what are you running for?

59:20.792 --> 59:22.458
Bai An, don't kill him!

59:24.833 --> 59:26.917
Tingting, you can't go with him.

59:26.917 --> 59:28.125
He is a wanted criminal!

59:30.500 --> 59:31.583
Bai An!

59:32.583 --> 59:33.583
Let's go!

59:48.833 --> 59:50.083
Bai An!

59:50.458 --> 59:52.000
Bai An!

59:52.708 --> 59:54.000
I'm going to Kill you.

59:54.583 --> 59:56.000
I'll kill you!

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.167
Are you okay?

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.042
I'll take you to a doctor right now.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:15.750
No, we've got too much attention around.

01:00:16.417 --> 01:00:19.417
We're still near the drug dealers' turf.

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:20.792
You don't do that.

01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:22.750
You'll die if we don't do anything.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.250
I have an idea.

01:00:49.292 --> 01:00:50.250
Is anybody there?

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.458
Open the door!

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:53.542
I'm coming! What's with all this knocking?

01:00:53.542 --> 01:00:54.750
Look how late it is!

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.083
Don't you know I'm sleeping?

01:00:56.083 --> 01:00:57.667
Doctor, please save him.

01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:04.000
Why don't you go to the hospital?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.625
Look what this place is.

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:06.917
It's for treating animals!

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:08.542
I'm a veterinarian!

01:01:13.833 --> 01:01:15.417
Veterinarians are also doctors.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.000
We can save animals

01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:18.958
as well as cure people.

01:01:20.250 --> 01:01:21.583
Easy there.

01:01:21.625 --> 01:01:22.458
It'll hurt a bit.

01:01:22.458 --> 01:01:23.833
Hang in there.

01:01:25.667 --> 01:01:26.583
Done.

01:01:36.542 --> 01:01:37.625
In my opinion,

01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:40.000
he should be out of danger for now.

01:01:40.542 --> 01:01:41.917
Why does he have a cold sweat?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.417
That's because his wound is infected,

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.125
so he's exhibiting symptoms of a fever.

01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:48.875
Then give him some medicine.

01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.500
Look, what I have here

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:55.250
is medicine for cats, dogs, and even pigs.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.292
So...

01:01:56.375 --> 01:01:57.333
Thank you.

01:01:57.583 --> 01:01:59.625
Of course.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:03.875
How can I get to the old Jiati Motel?

01:02:04.042 --> 01:02:05.333
What?

01:02:05.708 --> 01:02:07.250
How do we get to the old Jiati Motel?

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:09.167
That's easy.

01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:11.000
Just go outside and turn right.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.333
Walk three blocks,
and it'll be at the intersection.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.125
But as far as I know,

01:02:15.125 --> 01:02:17.792
it is not a good place.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:20.667
Well...

01:02:20.958 --> 01:02:22.250
It's a doctor's duty!

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:23.708
A doctor's duty!

01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:25.458
Take it.

01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:27.000
If you tell anyone,

01:02:27.417 --> 01:02:28.667
I'll kill you.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:35.583
Kindness knows no bounds.

01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:42.875
I have healing hands.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:46.500
I have healing hands.

01:02:59.833 --> 01:03:00.708
Is anybody here?

01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:03.042
Looking for a room?

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.083
Show me your ID.

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:07.333
According to the latest reports
from our station,

01:03:07.417 --> 01:03:11.958
the previously missing girl
from the He Family, He Ting,

01:03:12.042 --> 01:03:14.708
was spotted at the Lese Slum Market.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:16.750
She was seen with Bai An,

01:03:16.833 --> 01:03:21.083
the suspect wanted by the police
for the shooting incident.

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:22.875
The police suspect...

01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:25.667
Miss, my dad is sick.

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:27.542
We came to see a doctor.

01:03:27.667 --> 01:03:29.667
Our wallets were stolen.

01:03:29.667 --> 01:03:32.375
I only have a little cash. Please help us.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:35.375
The police claim
that the recent violence in Jiati...

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:37.542
You don't look like father and daughter.

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:40.833
...was linked to local drug cartels.

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:43.417
I've got it.

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:47.542
Your mom is a foreigner, isn't she?

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:51.542
Yes, my mom is a foreigner.

01:03:51.542 --> 01:03:53.000
My dad is a local.

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:56.958
Normally, a standard room
is 20 US dollars per night.

01:03:56.958 --> 01:03:59.458
But you guys don't have IDs.

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:01.417
That puts me in a difficult spot.

01:04:02.458 --> 01:04:05.792
...was found dead at his home yesterday.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:09.125
His family, including his wife and kids,
are either dead or missing.

01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:10.542
Go upstairs and turn right.

01:04:11.208 --> 01:04:12.042
Thank you.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:16.875
In response, Jiati's top police official

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:19.083
told the media

01:04:19.167 --> 01:04:25.333
that the Ballyvina police
would take a zero-tolerance approach...

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:27.375
Hello, Mr. Jiu.

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:29.667
They showed up.

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:36.792
When do we go look for Mr. Jiu?

01:04:38.042 --> 01:04:39.125
Just wait here.

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:41.167
He will show up.

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:43.750
This is his town.

01:04:56.042 --> 01:04:57.125
Eat this.

01:04:58.250 --> 01:04:59.625
My mother taught me this.

01:05:00.167 --> 01:05:02.292
A little candy can make a big difference

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:03.542
when you are hurt.

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:10.417
Bai An.

01:05:13.667 --> 01:05:15.125
I have a question for you.

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:17.083
Sure.

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:20.042
Is my dad really a drug dealer?

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.542
Why?

01:05:25.125 --> 01:05:26.583
Why do you ask now?

01:05:28.708 --> 01:05:29.583
I don't know.

01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:32.500
I trusted him.

01:05:33.458 --> 01:05:34.792
But now, it's not just you.

01:05:35.708 --> 01:05:37.417
Even the betel nut guy said so.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:40.375
I don't know who to trust anymore.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:43.208
It's like my dad was never the man I knew.

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.083
Bai An.

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:53.042
If, hypothetically speaking,

01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.917
my dad really did hurt your family,

01:05:57.167 --> 01:05:58.750
will you promise me something?

01:06:05.417 --> 01:06:06.250
Bai An?

01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:32.000
This man who is still sleeping is my dad.

01:06:33.958 --> 01:06:35.375
He has to work the night shift

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.625
and cannot return to China with us.

01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:44.167
Let's go to the airport.

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:46.583
I've packed your dinner.

01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:48.750
It's your favorite Thai fried rice.

01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:50.875
Take it to work and heat it up.

01:06:57.667 --> 01:06:58.583
This is...

01:06:58.667 --> 01:06:59.500
Dad.

01:07:00.167 --> 01:07:00.833
Mom.

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:02.250
Mom. And?

01:07:02.333 --> 01:07:03.542
Me!

01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:10.000
Let's go!

01:07:10.083 --> 01:07:11.375
Okay, let's go!

01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:25.625
Go kill him!

01:09:09.875 --> 01:09:10.833
Kill him!

01:09:12.375 --> 01:09:13.333
Come on!

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.208
Where is Clay's drug base?

01:10:55.458 --> 01:10:56.375
Tell me!

01:10:57.042 --> 01:10:59.667
In the forest at the Mei River Port.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:02.292
The drugs are transported out from there.

01:11:02.375 --> 01:11:04.750
I know you're a good fighter,
but you'd better give up.

01:11:04.833 --> 01:11:07.833
The police can control ordinary people,
but they can't control him.

01:11:08.583 --> 01:11:10.208
You will never survive!

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:11.500
Bai An!

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:24.792
Are you okay?

01:11:26.792 --> 01:11:27.875
I know where Clay is.

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.250
Let's go.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.542
I finally found you.

01:11:57.417 --> 01:11:59.417
I can't wait

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.333
to return all these wounds to you,

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.625
Bai An.

01:12:43.542 --> 01:12:46.208
Bai An!

01:12:46.292 --> 01:12:47.208
Save him!

01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:48.167
Bai An!

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.625
Tingting, are you okay?

01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:50.667
Save Bai An!

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:52.042
Tingting, come with me!

01:12:52.125 --> 01:12:53.333
I'm taking Bai An with me.

01:12:53.417 --> 01:12:55.333
Are you crazy? He wants to kill your dad!

01:12:56.042 --> 01:12:59.625
Bai An!

01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:41.542
Let's go! Get out of here!

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:43.042
Go!

01:13:43.042 --> 01:13:44.000
Freeze!

01:13:44.375 --> 01:13:45.583
Hand it over.

01:13:45.667 --> 01:13:46.875
It's all here.

01:13:46.958 --> 01:13:49.000
Please don't hurt us.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.708
No!

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.917
Baby!

01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:20.792
Don't leave me!

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:22.542
Please!

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.542
No!

01:14:35.417 --> 01:14:36.375
How are you?

01:14:44.125 --> 01:14:45.208
Stop!

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.375
Stop it!

01:14:47.667 --> 01:14:48.583
Are you crazy?

01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:53.208
If not for Wu Zheng, we'd be dead by now.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.000
How did you find us?

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:08.583
You had surgery and stayed at a motel.

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:10.833
You had already revealed your whereabouts.

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.583
There's been a lot of talk

01:15:13.667 --> 01:15:15.750
about both of you on the black market.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.542
Earlier,

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.375
my men reported to me

01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:27.500
that Tingting had called Lu Ping.

01:15:28.292 --> 01:15:30.000
I traced the signal,

01:15:30.667 --> 01:15:31.958
but I got there too late.

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:33.833
At the scene,

01:15:33.917 --> 01:15:36.417
I only found the body of an imposter cop.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.208
Later, just like you,

01:15:39.792 --> 01:15:41.625
I tried to find Mr. He's whereabouts.

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:43.750
I even investigated former employees

01:15:43.833 --> 01:15:45.333
who became smugglers.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.667
Then I found the betel nut guy.

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:50.125
Captain, Ms. He is
in the betel nut guy's hands.

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:53.042
And you know the rest.

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:55.958
What is this place?

01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:59.292
This is my safe house.

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:04.542
Your kung fu is pretty good.

01:16:05.083 --> 01:16:07.917
It seems you have a very unusual past.

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.292
By the way, let me return this to you.

01:16:19.417 --> 01:16:21.250
That is something you can't play with!

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:24.375
I didn't mean to. It fell out.

01:16:28.625 --> 01:16:29.958
Let's go find your father.

01:16:31.792 --> 01:16:32.958
It's very safe here.

01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:34.750
Wu Zheng will try to find my dad.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:36.000
You need to heal.

01:16:41.917 --> 01:16:42.750
Bai An!

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:48.958
Would you stop being so impulsive?

01:16:49.042 --> 01:16:51.625
The cartel outnumbers you.
You're alone and wounded.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.125
It's a death wish.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.500
You were not against me

01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:55.958
when I saved you from the mob.

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.583
You used me from the beginning.

01:16:59.417 --> 01:17:01.250
Since you have a new protector,

01:17:01.792 --> 01:17:03.917
you don't need me anymore.

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:06.958
Our deal is over.

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:09.083
That's not what I meant.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.667
I'm worried about you.

01:17:10.667 --> 01:17:12.542
You're worried about your father.

01:17:14.042 --> 01:17:16.292
I've heard about your story.

01:17:17.375 --> 01:17:18.625
I'll find the truth.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:23.083
The truth is that
He Yinghao killed my family.

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:35.833
My wife worked
for He Group for eight years.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.667
But a couple of days ago,

01:17:40.375 --> 01:17:43.083
she told me about
going back to her country.

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:47.875
Darling, you are being weird.

01:17:48.292 --> 01:17:49.500
Anything happen?

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:51.292
Tell me, please.

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:54.208
You can always trust me, okay?

01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:55.917
It's nothing.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.833
Just apply for leave.

01:17:58.125 --> 01:17:59.583
We'll wait for you back home.

01:18:05.458 --> 01:18:06.625
I later found out

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:09.333
it was all because my wife
discovered evidence

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:11.583
of He Yinghao smuggling drugs.

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:13.375
That's why she was killed.

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.792
It's all here.

01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:16.042
Please.

01:18:16.042 --> 01:18:18.292
Please don't hurt us.

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.917
Where's the backup copy?

01:18:22.208 --> 01:18:23.458
There is none.

01:18:25.542 --> 01:18:27.417
This is the flash drive.

01:18:29.375 --> 01:18:31.167
It contains the evidence.

01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:33.792
And for this, he killed my family.

01:18:35.083 --> 01:18:36.167
Impossible.

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.292
There's nothing he hates more than drugs.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:39.875
He would never touch them.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:43.500
Save it!

01:18:45.333 --> 01:18:47.875
I found a bounty in Kun Tai's phone

01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:49.292
for killing my wife.

01:18:49.417 --> 01:18:52.750
And all the clues
point back to He Yinghao.

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:54.000
Hello, Kun Tai!

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:55.500
Why aren't you here yet?

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.458
I'm here with the money!

01:18:58.292 --> 01:18:59.875
And before you kill me,

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.542
I'll kill him with my own hands!

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:05.333
Come on! Kill me!

01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:06.292
Bring it!

01:19:06.292 --> 01:19:07.500
Come on!

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:11.375
Wu Zheng.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:20.250
Because you saved Tingting's life,

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:21.875
I won't kill you.

01:19:22.833 --> 01:19:25.708
But don't appear in front of me again.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.333
Bai An!

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:35.750
Bai An!

01:19:43.583 --> 01:19:44.625
Is he okay?

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.208
I will let him go

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.542
after I rescue your dad.

01:19:59.792 --> 01:20:01.083
Hold on, He Ting.

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:05.000
I think you care more about him
than you do about your dad.

01:20:17.917 --> 01:20:18.750
Tingting!

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:20.500
Tingting!

01:20:20.583 --> 01:20:21.792
How are you? Are you okay?

01:20:21.875 --> 01:20:22.708
I'm fine.

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:24.833
Asa,

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:27.000
how did she get here?

01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:30.625
Why didn't you tell me you found Tingting?

01:20:31.375 --> 01:20:33.000
I basically run the company.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:35.083
Do you really think they would disobey me?

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.333
Tingting, come home with me.

01:20:39.417 --> 01:20:41.333
No, I'm not going home.

01:20:41.417 --> 01:20:42.667
I'm going to rescue my dad.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:43.792
Your dad?

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:47.708
Have you found Mr. He?

01:20:50.917 --> 01:20:52.417
The Clay Group did it.

01:20:53.208 --> 01:20:56.292
It was probably because of the drugs
that were seized by the police.

01:20:56.667 --> 01:20:57.958
It's not that simple.

01:20:58.208 --> 01:21:00.875
There's a traitor in the company
secretly smuggling drugs.

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:04.000
Bai An's wife was killed
because she found out about it.

01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:06.083
A traitor?

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:08.708
And it must be a core member.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.208
Don't move!

01:21:20.708 --> 01:21:22.708
Asa, what are you doing?

01:21:22.708 --> 01:21:23.792
Put the gun down

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:25.292
or I'll kill them.

01:21:26.958 --> 01:21:28.042
Put it down.

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.208
Take them to Mr. Clay.

01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:41.500
I'll take care of this.

01:21:43.417 --> 01:21:44.250
Let me go!

01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:45.208
Let go! Tingting!

01:21:45.208 --> 01:21:46.125
Let me go!

01:21:46.125 --> 01:21:48.333
Tingting!

01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:55.708
Let me go!

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:03.958
Asa,

01:22:05.292 --> 01:22:07.250
since when?

01:22:07.792 --> 01:22:09.250
It doesn't matter, does it?

01:22:10.375 --> 01:22:11.708
Okay, Asa.

01:22:12.917 --> 01:22:15.417
You had better run far away later.

01:22:17.083 --> 01:22:18.500
You have no chance.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Life and death are decreed by fate.
Wealth and rank are matters of destiny.

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:23.417
Don't blame me.

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:25.708
I'm just doing it for the money.

01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:39.000
Who the hell are you?

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:43.042
I'm just a ghost who has lost his family.

01:22:46.167 --> 01:22:47.875
Why do you risk your life?

01:22:49.875 --> 01:22:51.667
I get paid by the He family.

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:53.042
Risking my life for them

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:54.125
is easy to understand.

01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:55.875
What about you?

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:04.333
Just like you,

01:23:04.708 --> 01:23:06.042
I got paid, too.

01:23:12.583 --> 01:23:13.917
I think steak tastes the best

01:23:14.667 --> 01:23:15.875
when it is medium rare.

01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:19.875
Any rarer, it may taste bloody.

01:23:20.833 --> 01:23:23.333
And it becomes too tough
if it's cooked any longer.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.500
I think the same goes for being a man.

01:23:31.042 --> 01:23:32.625
What's the key?

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:34.542
Having the right amount of fire.

01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:37.792
It wouldn't be good for anyone

01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:39.917
if we have a falling-out.

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:43.542
I have my limits.

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:46.125
And I really don't have anything

01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:48.333
to say to drug dealers.

01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:50.708
Courteous words aren't necessary, Mr. He.

01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:54.750
They cannot be eaten or spent as money.

01:23:55.792 --> 01:23:56.708
By the way, Mr. He,

01:23:57.333 --> 01:23:59.167
my overseas clients

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.750
are still waiting anxiously
for my shipments.

01:24:11.833 --> 01:24:13.542
Tingting!

01:24:13.625 --> 01:24:14.500
Are you okay?

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:17.542
Tingting!

01:24:17.958 --> 01:24:18.958
Tingting!

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
What do you want?

01:24:30.708 --> 01:24:33.000
Mr. He, sign the contract.

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:34.917
I will let her go

01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:37.542
and also guarantee that He Group

01:24:37.625 --> 01:24:39.500
won't encounter any trouble from now on.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:40.708
Otherwise...

01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:41.625
I'll sign it.

01:24:45.167 --> 01:24:46.500
I knew it.

01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:48.667
Mr. He, you are a wise man.

01:24:52.917 --> 01:24:53.833
Here!

01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:55.708
Let's drink together!

01:24:55.792 --> 01:24:56.833
Here's to

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:58.750
a pleasant cooperation!

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:00.292
Here! Cheers!

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.083
Don't celebrate just yet.

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:05.625
The man who made us lose the goods
is called Bai An.

01:25:05.917 --> 01:25:10.042
He looks like
just an ordinary warehouse manager.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.792
But before that,

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:17.125
he was a professional security specialist.

01:25:17.417 --> 01:25:19.292
What's your point?

01:25:20.083 --> 01:25:23.625
Bai An was protecting the girl
the whole time,

01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:25.958
but he has been looking for a chance

01:25:26.250 --> 01:25:28.292
to kill He Yinghao.

01:25:32.250 --> 01:25:34.792
I lost 20 million US dollars.

01:25:35.292 --> 01:25:37.792
Is that all you've got for me?

01:25:38.583 --> 01:25:39.500
Listen, Long Tai,

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:42.833
if my dad hadn't insisted
that I keep you as a dog,

01:25:42.833 --> 01:25:44.458
you wouldn't be here today.

01:25:51.083 --> 01:25:52.917
You are less than a dog.

01:26:07.208 --> 01:26:08.208
Clean it up.

01:26:09.042 --> 01:26:10.250
We'll have a visitor soon.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:11.833
Okay.

01:26:26.167 --> 01:26:27.250
Intruders!

01:27:49.792 --> 01:27:50.750
Split up and search!

01:28:52.083 --> 01:28:53.250
Interesting.

01:28:54.208 --> 01:28:56.042
A man with a deep hatred

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:59.625
has compassion for his enemy's daughter.

01:29:01.875 --> 01:29:03.500
Let's play a game.

01:29:08.542 --> 01:29:10.208
Kill him

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:12.542
and I will let the girl go.

01:29:26.167 --> 01:29:27.833
Your game sucks.

01:29:34.167 --> 01:29:35.833
Interesting.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.708
Maybe we can be friends.

01:29:40.292 --> 01:29:41.833
We won't be friends.

01:29:42.208 --> 01:29:43.542
Let them go

01:29:44.333 --> 01:29:46.125
and we won't be enemies.

01:29:46.792 --> 01:29:48.000
Enemies?

01:29:48.583 --> 01:29:50.458
You're not the only one.

01:30:18.833 --> 01:30:19.792
Go.

01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:24.250
Go inside.

01:32:01.917 --> 01:32:03.167
It seems

01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:04.625
that I overestimated you.

01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:08.083
You are not qualified to be my enemy.

01:32:09.417 --> 01:32:10.250
I'm sorry

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:14.125
for not leaving your family intact
last time.

01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:16.750
What are you talking about?

01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:21.750
Before he died, that punk Clay

01:32:22.125 --> 01:32:24.125
was all about booze and women.

01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:27.167
I did everything,

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:30.000
including your family.

01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:34.167
So much for that.

01:33:34.792 --> 01:33:39.042
Now you can reunite with your family.

01:34:19.417 --> 01:34:20.333
Bai An!

01:35:26.833 --> 01:35:27.667
Bai An!

01:35:28.792 --> 01:35:29.625
Bai An!

01:35:34.542 --> 01:35:35.375
Let's go.

01:35:42.833 --> 01:35:43.708
Dad!

01:35:48.833 --> 01:35:49.625
Long Tai!

01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:50.958
Let Tingting go!

01:35:52.583 --> 01:35:53.667
Let Tingting go.

01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:55.625
Long Tai, let Tingting go.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.583
I can give you anything, okay?

01:35:57.667 --> 01:35:58.875
Tingting!

01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:01.917
You are not the ones

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.500
who can survive in this world.

01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:05.708
You bear too many burdens.

01:36:05.792 --> 01:36:06.958
If you want to save her,

01:36:07.125 --> 01:36:08.833
then kill each other.

01:36:10.167 --> 01:36:11.875
This is the time.

01:36:13.458 --> 01:36:15.792
Next time, kick them between the legs.

01:36:15.792 --> 01:36:16.833
Don't bite.

01:36:42.917 --> 01:36:43.917
Bai An!

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:46.250
Bai An!

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:02.333
Bai An,

01:37:03.375 --> 01:37:05.667
I never hurt your family.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.917
And I hate drugs more than anything.

01:37:10.292 --> 01:37:12.500
If they hadn't threatened me
with Tingting,

01:37:14.333 --> 01:37:15.833
I would never have compromised.

01:37:17.417 --> 01:37:19.125
I believe your daughter,

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:21.167
so I believe you too.

01:37:29.042 --> 01:37:30.167
Thank you, An.

01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:32.500
In fact, you have no idea

01:37:33.333 --> 01:37:35.792
how much I envied your daughter
these past few days.

01:37:35.875 --> 01:37:38.125
You could abandon everything for them

01:37:38.542 --> 01:37:40.000
to fight the whole world.

01:37:40.958 --> 01:37:41.875
All this time,

01:37:42.667 --> 01:37:44.917
I thought I didn't
have a father's love like this.

01:37:45.625 --> 01:37:46.917
But now I realize

01:37:47.292 --> 01:37:48.667
that my dad is just like you.

01:37:49.167 --> 01:37:51.167
He has always loved me with all his might,

01:37:51.542 --> 01:37:53.208
although he doesn't express it well.

01:37:56.583 --> 01:38:00.208
No father will refuse
to be his daughter's hero.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:02.917
And when the time comes,

01:38:03.792 --> 01:38:05.708
it is the hardest thing.

01:38:13.125 --> 01:38:13.958
Bai An,

01:38:15.292 --> 01:38:16.250
thank you.

01:38:55.167 --> 01:38:57.167
Who are you? What are you going to do?

01:39:04.875 --> 01:39:08.083
Have you ever seen a butterfly
get trapped in a spider's web?

01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:10.417
They think they can get away

01:39:10.417 --> 01:39:12.833
by using their wings' scales.

01:39:15.042 --> 01:39:16.792
But sometimes they can't.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:20.792
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:39:20.875 --> 01:39:22.708
If you play with fire,

01:39:23.250 --> 01:39:24.500
you'll get burned!

01:39:25.333 --> 01:39:26.417
Who the hell are you?

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.292
I've never seen you before.

01:39:29.208 --> 01:39:31.458
You've met my wife and kid before, right?

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:34.500
Do you really think you can get away

01:39:34.583 --> 01:39:36.333
after what you have done?

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:40.167
When He Ting contacted you the first time,

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:43.583
you came up with an idea.

01:39:44.417 --> 01:39:45.500
We found He Ting.

01:39:47.083 --> 01:39:49.375
You exposed He Ting to the phony cop.

01:39:50.375 --> 01:39:52.833
You killed him after he failed.

01:39:53.375 --> 01:39:55.625
Tell Wu Zheng about the phony cop.

01:39:55.708 --> 01:39:57.375
And then you used Wu Zheng

01:39:57.458 --> 01:39:59.000
to track us down.

01:39:59.083 --> 01:40:00.583
Ms. Lu, we found He Ting.

01:40:00.667 --> 01:40:01.833
She is at the safe house.

01:40:02.542 --> 01:40:03.500
You made two plans.

01:40:03.583 --> 01:40:04.417
Don't move!

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.292
You pretended to be caught.

01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:08.625
So however things played out,

01:40:08.708 --> 01:40:10.167
it would not affect you.

01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:12.125
But you forgot about me.

01:40:12.375 --> 01:40:14.167
I saw that you had bribed Asa.

01:40:14.375 --> 01:40:16.208
He was following your orders,

01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:18.375
just like those employees

01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:21.042
who were helping you traffic drugs.

01:40:23.125 --> 01:40:25.083
I've been caught in a spider's web.

01:40:26.542 --> 01:40:27.708
But Long Tai

01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:30.667
is not the spider that traps me.

01:40:32.167 --> 01:40:34.583
You're in Mr. He's web.

01:40:39.417 --> 01:40:42.292
It has been ten years
since I followed him to this foreign land.

01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:45.000
But I've never been able to be myself.

01:40:45.792 --> 01:40:47.375
It's like I'm forever trapped

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.250
in the shell of another woman.

01:40:50.458 --> 01:40:52.750
He Ting will never accept me.

01:40:55.542 --> 01:40:57.042
I am just a substitute.

01:40:58.333 --> 01:41:01.500
So you used Long Tai to get rid of Mr. He,

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:05.083
and he used you to kill Clay.

01:41:06.167 --> 01:41:09.917
My wife discovered evidence

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.208
that you were using He Group
to traffic drugs,

01:41:15.167 --> 01:41:18.292
so you destroyed my family.

01:41:19.667 --> 01:41:21.000
If you want to blame someone,

01:41:22.167 --> 01:41:24.417
then blame your wife
for affecting my bottom line.

01:41:38.208 --> 01:41:39.917
It looks like she turned you down.

01:41:41.083 --> 01:41:42.875
We can't allow her to ruin everything.

01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.542
I just want to take my destiny
into my own hands! How is that wrong?

01:41:47.625 --> 01:41:49.833
The He Group
will always belong to the He family.

01:41:50.417 --> 01:41:52.125
I was so close to getting everything!

01:41:52.208 --> 01:41:53.417
But you ruined everything!

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.000
You!

01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:07.250
My family did not deserve that.

01:42:10.375 --> 01:42:11.250
What are you doing?

01:42:11.583 --> 01:42:12.458
What are you doing?

01:42:12.542 --> 01:42:13.292
No!

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:16.458
Wait a minute! Don't kill me!
Listen, I was very wrong!

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:19.625
Forgive me! I shouldn't have
hurt your kid and your wife!

01:42:19.792 --> 01:42:21.750
Don't kill me! Please forgive me.

01:42:21.833 --> 01:42:22.958
Please!

01:42:23.583 --> 01:42:24.417
Please!

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.583
Sorry!

01:42:25.833 --> 01:42:27.083
I shouldn't have done it.

01:42:31.417 --> 01:42:36.958
My wife and kid were nice people.

01:42:38.042 --> 01:42:39.917
They forgive you.

01:42:40.583 --> 01:42:41.417
But

01:42:42.542 --> 01:42:43.792
I won't.

01:42:43.875 --> 01:42:45.958
Money! I can give you money.

01:42:46.083 --> 01:42:47.583
A lot of money!

01:42:47.667 --> 01:42:49.500
Don't kill me! Please don't kill me!

01:42:49.583 --> 01:42:51.000
It's all because of He Yinghao!

01:42:51.083 --> 01:42:53.292
He Yinghao forced me into doing it!

01:42:53.375 --> 01:42:55.250
He pushed me to this point!

01:42:55.583 --> 01:42:57.500
HE GROUP SHARES TRANSFER CONTRACT

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:01.958
Impossible.

01:43:02.375 --> 01:43:04.667
There's an old Chinese saying,

01:43:05.417 --> 01:43:08.167
"Natural disasters can be endured,

01:43:08.708 --> 01:43:10.750
but not disasters
brought upon yourself."

01:43:12.167 --> 01:43:14.458
You ruined yourself.

01:43:14.542 --> 01:43:15.667
It really wasn't me.

01:43:15.875 --> 01:43:17.333
Don't kill me.

01:43:18.958 --> 01:43:21.292
You've got a minute to say farewell.

01:43:27.792 --> 01:43:28.583
No.

01:43:31.667 --> 01:43:32.500
No.

01:43:32.583 --> 01:43:33.625
Don't go.

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.917
No!

01:43:44.542 --> 01:43:46.208
Are you listening, Yinghao?

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.417
I'm sorry, Yinghao!

01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:49.542
Sorry, Tingting!

01:43:50.375 --> 01:43:52.500
It's all my fault!

01:43:52.583 --> 01:43:53.583
Sorry!

01:43:54.333 --> 01:43:55.167
l...

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.750
I wanted too much.

01:43:56.833 --> 01:43:57.833
It was really me.

01:43:57.917 --> 01:44:00.000
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have done all this.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.875
Can you forgive me?

01:44:02.958 --> 01:44:04.417
Tingting? Yinghao?

01:45:13.583 --> 01:45:16.000
This man who is still sleeping is my dad.

01:45:19.667 --> 01:45:21.125
He has to work the night shift

01:45:21.208 --> 01:45:23.500
and cannot return to China with us.

01:45:28.833 --> 01:45:30.292
Let's go to the airport.

01:45:31.583 --> 01:45:33.125
I've packed your dinner.

01:45:33.208 --> 01:45:35.500
It's your favorite Thai fried rice.

01:45:35.583 --> 01:45:37.000
Take it to work and heat it up.

01:45:45.833 --> 01:45:46.500
Dad.

01:45:46.583 --> 01:45:48.208
Dad. And?

01:45:48.292 --> 01:45:49.333
Mom.

01:45:50.250 --> 01:45:51.125
And?

01:45:51.208 --> 01:45:52.042
Me!

01:45:52.125 --> 01:45:53.125
Okay!
