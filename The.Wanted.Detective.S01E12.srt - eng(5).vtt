[Honored for Seniority and Virtue]

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.950
Get medicine
according to this prescription.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.000
Within half a month,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.259
Madam's health will certainly improve.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.120
You're so kind, Mr. Feng.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.789
I don't know how to repay you.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.920
Miss Huo, it's nothing.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.979
No need to repay me.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.480
The bond between you and Madam

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.590
is truly touching.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.790
It's my honor

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.950
to treat her.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.560
You two talk.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.000
I'll go out.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.670
Well? Did they confess?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.190
They admitted to killing Xue Qianshan

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.520
but denied involvement

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.960
in General Huo's death.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.710
That woman had an affair with Li Xiao.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.170
If my father had found out,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.440
she'd have been dead.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.560
Besides,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.079
she was in charge of the pharmacy,

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.710
which gave her
the best opportunity to do it.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.310
Miss Huo, you do know a lot,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.030
but not everything.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.310
Actually, General Huo knew

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.400
about their relationship

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.150
and signed the divorce agreement
with Mrs. Huo.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.560
But before they could leave,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.960
General Huo passed away.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.880
Divorce agreement?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.310
Why would my father divorce her?

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.360
Mrs. Huo confessed.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.079
She said General Huo

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.520
was infertile.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.060
So…

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.590
General did have a hidden illness.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.870
But that was

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.750
after I gave birth to Dairong.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.130
Dairong is indeed

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.690
General's and my daughter.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.150
I see.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.560
Constable Zhong,
I think you've misunderstood.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.870
We've discovered that General Huo's death

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.280
may be connected to an incident

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.810
that happened 23 years ago.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.260
You once said

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.430
you'd just entered the household
at that time.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.630
Did General Huo ever mention anything?

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.360
Managing the pharmacy isn't hard proof.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.280
Besides,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.150
there are many ways to poison someone.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.000
What are you implying, Constable Xiao?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.710
I heard Madam Feng once acquired
some wellness tea

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.360
for General Huo from a famous physician.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.420
Is there

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.570
any of that tea left?

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.970
You can't find evidence

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.170
to convict those two,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.560
so you're suspecting my mother and me?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.000
Miss Huo, you're a smart girl,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.310
and you know who I am.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.710
You should understand

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.560
that solving a case means

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.870
ruling out every possibility.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.710
Besides,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.320
don't you want to prove your innocence?

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.150
I understand.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.070
Please wait a moment.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.120
I'll go get it now.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.120
You don't trust me?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.790
General never told me about matters

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.120
outside the household.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.720
I don't know anything.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.480
Even if I did hear something,

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.159
it's been so long—

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.030
I've already forgotten.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.720
Madam Feng,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.200
this matter is very serious.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.310
It concerns not only General Huo

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.560
but everyone still living,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.510
especially Miss Huo.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.240
If you recall anything,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.480
please let me know.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.950
Alright.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.600
I'm a bit tired.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.750
If there's nothing else,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.360
please leave.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.720
Alright.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.870
Take care.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.800
[Cassia seed, burdock root,
mulberry fruit, dandelion…]

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.410
This is the wellness tea bag

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.680
[Mulberry leaf, polygonatum,
poria, and honeysuckle.]

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.800
and its recipe.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.380
You may have them examined.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.830
Thank you.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.510
Is there anything else?

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.159
No. Sorry to bother you.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.190
How did it go on your end?

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.750
Madam Feng's reaction was unusual.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.440
Our speculation

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.500
is likely correct,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.830
but she is hiding something

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.560
and wouldn't reveal anything.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.920
Some things can't be hidden

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.680
no matter how hard you try.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.270
Feng Qingzhuo,

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.200
take this tea bag for examination.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.630
I'll stay
and keep watching the Huo family.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.240
Okay.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.270
Coroner Feng said

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.750
as long as you keep taking it,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.120
you'll be fine soon.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.160
Did they give you a hard time?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.040
They just did their job

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.120
and asked some questions.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.320
Don't worry, Mother.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.040
Mother,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.870
what's wrong?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.400
Did Constable Zhong give you trouble?

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.070
No.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.750
Dairong,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.950
let's go out for a walk.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.360
Sure.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.159
I'll help you to the courtyard.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.950
No.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.360
I want to take you out of the Huo Mansion,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.480
out of the capital.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.360
Out of the capital?

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.880
Mother, where's this coming from?

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.760
So many things
have happened with the Huo household,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.680
and everyone

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.430
is watching us closely.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.310
In this big mansion,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.600
there are schemes everywhere.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.040
Though you're clever,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.430
when facing truly wicked people,

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.480
you won't be able to deal with them.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.240
I'm afraid something might happen to you.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.000
It's better

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.120
if we leave for now.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.070
When things calm down,

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.950
we can return, alright?

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.510
Mother, I know you're worried about me.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.440
But don't worry.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.720
I have a plan.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.190
We'll both be fine.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.070
I've examined it.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.440
The ingredients in the tea bag

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.830
match the recipe exactly.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.720
Taking it long-term

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.159
is very good for health.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.510
Most importantly,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.390
there's no trace of poison at all.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:39.260
Madam Feng and her daughter

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.490
must be innocent.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.310
Huo Dairong is too smart

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:42.920
to give us

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.650
poisoned tea for examination.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.680
Then wasn't having me test it

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.000
a waste of time?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.800
No.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.159
I had you examine the tea

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:53.420
so you'd have something to compare with.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.860
Compare with what?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.950
Beiming.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.190
I found what you asked me

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:58.920
to look for.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.510
What's this?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.820
When I was inspecting

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.870
General Huo's study,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.360
I noticed this flower was positioned

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.000
differently from the other plants.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
More importantly,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.950
all other flowers
have withered this season,

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.680
yet this one is still blooming.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.920
So I asked Tong Shuang

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.780
to do me a favor.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.160
So the medical consultation

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.340
was just to keep Huo Dairong occupied

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:32.360
and give Tong Shuang time?

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:32.909
Exactly.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.929
Huo Dairong thought

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.240
that after Mrs. Huo
and Li Xiao were arrested,

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.360
the case was closed,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.720
so she temporarily let her guard down.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.630
So when I mentioned

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.000
the wellness tea to her,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.150
she wasn't surprised at all.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:42.610
She had clearly prepared.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.789
Prepared?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.790
Huo Dairong didn't just

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.080
swap out the tea bags in advance.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.200
When she took me

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.440
to General Huo's study,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.080
I noticed
that General Huo's tea set

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.200
had been replaced with a new one.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.270
So regarding the wellness tea,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:02.380
she didn't

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.140
slip up at all.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.670
But no plan is ever perfect.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:05.750
Look here.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.910
There are leftover tea leaves here.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.670
The tea dregs
are mixed with fallen leaves in the soil,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.080
making them difficult to notice.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.720
I guess General Huo had the habit

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.480
of pouring the last cup of tea

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.750
into the flowerpot.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:15.600
Over time,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.360
the poison in the tea

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.870
caused this flower to mutate.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.960
So the issue was the water
used for watering.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.910
I see.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.320
Miss Huo didn't know

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.840
General Huo had this habit,

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.210
so she focused all her efforts

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.670
on changing the tea set

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.440
and overlooked

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.510
this flowerpot.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.270
Smart.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.870
Well?

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:32.450
Any way to prove it?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.270
Let me think.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.650
[Honored for Seniority and Virtue]

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.670
Beiming,

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.790
what is it?

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.040
I suddenly understand

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.790
why Huo Dairong was
still willing to help me

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.590
after discovering my identity.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.720
Is she planning to harm you?

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.600
After Feng Qingzhuo finishes testing,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.200
I'll confront her directly.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.210
This flower itself isn't poisonous.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.610
For now, I can't think of

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.480
a way to confirm it.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.150
Aren't you always saying you're unbeatable

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.390
in medicine and poison?

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:23.970
What now?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.240
Can't even deal with a flower?

[Utter Devotion]

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.320
Miss Huo,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.110
are you looking for this?

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.200
Xiao Beiming,
your reputation is well-earned—

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.600
always one step ahead

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.910
and leaving no loose ends.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.270
We found the same poison

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.290
in this flowerpot

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.720
as in General Huo's body.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.630
Wait, I'm not done eating!

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.120
-What are you doing, Madman?
-I'm not mad.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.640
Go buy me

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.390
a goat right now.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.510
A goat? You want to eat goat?

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.750
I need it alive!

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.750
I've figured out
how to test for the poison.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.470
Cut the crap.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.730
Go buy it now.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.750
Red crystal has a foul smell,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.550
but if the dosage is controlled,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.810
its smell can be completely masked

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.830
by the wellness tea's herbal scent.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.010
Impressive, Coroner Feng.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.150
So it was you who killed General Huo?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.800
That's right.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.720
It was me.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.100
But he was your father!

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.670
My father?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.130
What kind of father would treat

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.460
his daughter like that?

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.740
Ever since I was young,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.720
he had treated me

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.150
like an annoying object,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.960
always ignoring me.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.080
Then he married that woman

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.320
and let her bully us

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.600
and target us.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.630
And what did he do?

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.320
He turned a blind eye and did nothing.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.160
Shouldn't I hate him?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.670
Shouldn't I kill him?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.230
Just because of resentment,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.840
you poisoned

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.120
General Huo's tea?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.000
That's right.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.030
I knew the poison was a hallucinogen.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.790
So I secretly

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.390
added it to his wellness tea.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.630
I thought

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.860
he'd just get sick and die slowly.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.360
But I never imagined

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.000
he'd strangle himself

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.670
under the effects of the hallucinations.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.960
That was karma.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.750
Just to poison him,

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.410
you even

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:53.750
used your own mother?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600
After killing him

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.200
and pinning it on that woman,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.670
I'd be the only mistress

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:04.960
of the Huo household.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.120
By that time,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:06.970
my mother could

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.390
live her best life.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.000
It was worth it.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.440
I had no other choice.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.600
Miss Huo,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.960
at this point,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.200
telling the truth

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.630
is your only way out.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.150
I did kill him.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.870
Everything I just said is true.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.000
She's lying.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.080
Mother,

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.030
you're not well.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.320
You shouldn't be out of bed.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.200
Qing Ying, help my mother
back to her room.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200
Kneel.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.600
I...

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.200
Kneel!

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:43.790
Mother,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.150
I was wrong.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.550
I killed Father.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.600
They've already found me out.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.550
The evidence is solid.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.950
There's no escape for me.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.080
Mother,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.000
I've failed you as your daughter.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.510
I won't be able
to care for you in your old age.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:56.600
Silly girl,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.910
you think your little trick

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:00.750
can fool these officers?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.840
You think you can take the fall for me?

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.480
Mother,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:04.870
what are you talking about?

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:05.960
I killed Father.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.360
It had nothing to do with you.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.510
Qing Ying, take my mother back.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.840
Fine, then tell me—

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.040
hallucinogenic herbs are all banned.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.360
What kind of pharmacy
would sell them to you?

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.250
Where did you

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.360
get these herbs?

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.240
Get up.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.210
What's meant to happen
will happen eventually.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.150
Help me sit down.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.790
My Lords,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.240
I came here

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.360
to clarify things.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.240
I killed General.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.360
What exactly happened?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.790
It started

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:10.390
as an accident.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.270
Six months ago,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.200
General was troubled by something

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.750
and often had me accompany him
in the study.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.150
Later, by chance,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.480
I met

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.840
a limping physician.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.320
He gave me a bottle of pills.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.670
He said if I ground them into powder

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.910
and added it to tea,

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.960
General would forget his worries

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.150
and treat me with affection.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.750
I didn't really believe it,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.360
but I wanted to try.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.440
Surprisingly, after General took the tea,

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.000
he became energetic.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.320
After that, he had me

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.510
brew tea for him every day.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.320
And he treated me

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.790
with growing affection.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.790
But later,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.240
I started to notice

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.750
something was wrong.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.120
Addiction.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.200
That's right.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.360
General became more energetic

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.390
but also

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.790
more irritable.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.120
I tried to stop giving him the tea.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.000
General,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.750
that's all the tea for today.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.000
But at that time,

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.440
he was like a wild beast

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.440
and even beat me badly.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:27.950
I had no choice

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.320
but to keep brewing the tea for him.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.000
I thought

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.000
I could just endure it.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.240
But then one day,

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.750
after he drank the tea…

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.240
General,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.030
you're still up so late?

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.270
General,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.200
let me help you to bed.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.500
The ghost of Haiya.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.940
The ghost of Haiya!

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.069
I'm going to kill her.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.180
-I'm going to kill her!
-General.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:17.680

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.650
The way General looked at Dairong…

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.590
I'll never forget it.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.400
I'd never allow him

to hurt my Dairong.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.200
So I decided

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.720
to kill him.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.480
By then,
he couldn't notice anything unusual,

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.270
so I increased the dosage.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:51.310
I watched him spiral into madness.

I can find a way to save you.

That day, you saw through my identity

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.560
and chose to keep my secret.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.030
You were planning

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.830
if we let them keep digging like this,

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.160
it'll lead to disaster.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.550
Everything is going as I planned.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.000
But...

00:26:58.030 --> 00:26:59.920
Go do what you need to do.

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:01.830
Yes.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.080
She definitely isn't
the one behind all this.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.730
My Lady,

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.230
Constable Zhong is here.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.480
Miss Huo,

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.570
my condolences.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.680
I know you're not here

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.790
to comfort me.

00:27:58.270 --> 00:27:59.400
Today,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.090
I just want to cry and mourn my mother.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.350
But

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.880
the more I try to cry,

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.330
the harder it becomes.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.920
No one can understand

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.680
the pain I'm feeling.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.530
I understand how you feel.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.510
Miss Huo,

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.970
so many people have died already.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.350
Constable Xiao's secret

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.550
is safe with me.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.690
Yes, many people have died.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.880
I don't want

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.640
to hurt anyone else.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.070
You have something to say.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:09.750
Go ahead.

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.830
You can't keep things to yourself.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.790
So just say it.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.070
That limping physician...

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.920
I think I know who he is.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.160
Who is he?

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.350
Beiming!

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:35.640
Beiming!

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:37.940
Beiming, wake up!

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:39.640
Beiming!

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.480
Beiming!

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.400
Beiming!

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.510
How is he?

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.640
The frost toxin has flared up again.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.450
I didn't expect

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:54.510
the second attack to come so soon.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:55.790
I've already performed acupuncture.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.350
He should wake up soon.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.960
But this time,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.420
it's worse than last time.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:01.480
I don't know

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.750
when the third attack happens…

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:03.480
Move!

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.270
Tong Shuang.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.960
Even though the murderer
in the Huo Mansion case

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.350
has taken her own life,

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.750
I still don't think

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.110
it's that simple.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.200
You're still trying to connect this case

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.790
to Xiao Beiming?

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.510
Even if there is a connection,

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.000
our only lead now

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.030
is that limping physician.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.000
With just that one clue,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.830
how are we supposed

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.240
to catch Xiao Beiming?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.940
But I have a strong feeling

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.350
that Xiao Beiming is in the capital—

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:39.210
maybe even right under our noses.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.030
Father,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.420
give me a few more days.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.400
I swear I'll catch him.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.330
It's not that I won't give you time.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.550
It's that we truly have no time left.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.590
Do you think your instincts

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:49.720
can save both our lives

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.720
in these last few days?

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.790
Alright.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.000
I'll have Li Long investigate

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.330
the limping physician.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.750
You focus on finding
another way out for us.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.880
Even if we're doomed,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.590
we can't

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.720
bet everything on one clue.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:54.240
So you're saying

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.350
Madam Feng was

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.550
unknowingly

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.750
using forbidden medicine,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.210
which led to this tragedy.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.080
That physician is suspicious.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.200
Besides the limp,

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.510
are there any other characteristics?

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:07.750
According to Madam Feng,

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.240
he seemed to be a wandering physician

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.830
who profited
from selling restricted drugs.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.070
Apart from Madam Feng,

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.130
no one has seen him.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:29.650
How's it going?

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.000
Have you found

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.200
a way to save Beiming?

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.960
I've gone through all the medical books

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.200
but found nothing.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.710
However, I do have a new idea.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.510
This is no time

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:45.160
for half-answers.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.790
This method is extremely dangerous.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.250
We should talk it through.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.310
What are you saying?

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:55.960
Blood-freezing Frost is the deadliest

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.200
frost toxin I've ever seen.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.040
It can't be neutralized

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.830
by common herbs

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:00.230
available in the market.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.790
I want to fight poison with poison.

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:03.720
Fight poison with poison?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.240
According to the principle
of yin and yang,

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.790
what can counteract Blood-freezing Frost

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.110
must be something extremely powerful

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:09.240
and fiery hot.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.070
Only one thing

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:13.200
comes to mind.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.440
[Fire Cicada,
a poison of extreme yang and heat]

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.830
What is a Fire Cicada?

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.360
Why have I never heard of it?

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.160
It's incredibly rare.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.790
It's a herb that grows only

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.000
at volcanic craters.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.330
It looks like a cicada,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.640
hence the name.

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.510
With the Fire Cicada as a primer,

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.960
I might be able to

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.590
counteract the Blood-freezing Frost.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.510
Then try it right away!

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.110
As I said,
the Fire Cicada is extremely rare.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.030
It's not something you can just buy

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:38.920
at the market.

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.920
Even if we do obtain it,

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.830
I can't guarantee

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:41.640
it'll work.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.110
If it doesn't, I fear

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:44.770
Beiming may die because of it.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.170
This method is too dangerous.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.640
Regardless of the risk,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.200
getting the Fire Cicada first

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.860
is better than doing nothing.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.110
Where can I find it?

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.350
I'll go right away.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.120
According to my master's medical book,

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.840
it can only be found
at the Ghost Market in the capital.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.800
I've only read about this place
in medical books.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.150
Why are all the things here

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.110
so strange and eerie?

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:54.880
Some are robbed,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.630
some stolen,

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.150
some taken from murder victims,

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.280
and some even dug up

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.190
from ancestral graves.

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.590
Of course they're eerie.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.960
No wonder it's called the Ghost Market.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:03.800
Everything here

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.260
can't see the light of day.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.280
Why are they

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.670
all staring at us?

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.510
Have we alerted them?

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.360
Maybe they smelled the scent of outsiders.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:15.630
The rules of the Ghost Market:

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:17.000
no questions about who you are;

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.400
no questions
about where the goods came from.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.710
We need to stay careful.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:20.580
Don't get into trouble.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.190
Got it.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.410
Look, the Fire Cicada.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.250
That's the Fire Cicada.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:53.360
Don't move.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.280
How much is this?

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.670
How much are you offering?

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:06.760
50 taels.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.180
Is that enough?

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.410
100 taels then.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.760
Still not enough?

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.000
My rule for selling

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.320
is to trade one thing for another.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.150
What do you think

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.280
you have on you that's valuable enough

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.880
to exchange for that thing?

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.820
This thumb ring is a token from a bank.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:36.190
It can be exchanged
for money or land deeds.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.920
This is

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.550
the most valuable thing on me.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.080
Can I trade it for your herb?

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:43.760
Of course not.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.760
What exactly do you want?

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.550
Your eyes are beautiful, miss.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:55.480
I wonder

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.670
if I could trade this

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.630
for one of your eyes.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:05.280
The choice is yours.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:46.400
What...

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.960
What's happening?

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.510
Hand it over!

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:50.400
Never!

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:07.920
You can't escape.
