00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.560
Master.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.280
What are...

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.000
You rogue.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:46.439
Get out!

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:48.879
Master.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.920
You're actually consuming
a demon's primordial spirit?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.840
Why?

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.560
Are you disobeying me now?

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:09.319
From now on,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.439
you are no longer my master.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.520
What do we do?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.960
It's been a month
since Her Majesty's return,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.400
but she's been quiet.

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.240
What exactly happened?

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.960
I'm worried sick.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.479
Do you think Her Majesty has become

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.240
a mute?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.159
Well,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.879
you should stop talking nonsense.

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.080
If worse comes to worst,

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.120
give Her Majesty a performance.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.199
After all, you're an all-rounder.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.080
I'm way less than you!

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.319
With your funny appearance,

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.390
you should give her a performance!

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.919
Enough!

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.000
Now isn't the time

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.240
to be joking around.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.360
I feel depressed

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:05.840
seeing Her Majesty in that state!

(One month later)

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:15.879
Why are you here?

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.240
Chief Fan.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.360
I've brought Momo home.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.959
Having learned

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.480
about her identity as a half-demon
on that night,

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.600
she couldn't accept it.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.839
She then bumped into a demon slayer

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:43.360
and put up a tough fight.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.170
Her true form was revealed
after sustaining a heavy injury.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:46.519
Master Shang said

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.959
all 24 types of cooling herbs

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:48.920
are needed

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.120
to recover her human form.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.990
I tried the herbs I came across
along the way,

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.000
but I ended up getting poisoned.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.320
Luckily, I managed to make it back
to Qianchun Mountain.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.079
I hope it's not too late

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.240
to save her.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.360
Thank you for all the hard work.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.290
Ask the Old Turtle
to help you get rid of the poison later.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.319
Your Majesty.

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.000
Your Majesty.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.360
Speak.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.199
I sneaked into Moyuan City
and asked around

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.279
as you told me.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.920
The people there said

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:14.959
the consort has been sent

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.199
to the suburb for recuperation.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.120
They said...

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.079
Cut to the chase.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.600
The consort has been in a coma,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.040
and his days are numbered.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.879
It's the demon core.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.040
Shen Wangchen!

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:39.680
Shen Wangchen!

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.360
Shen Wangchen!

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:50.879
Shen Wangchen!

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:55.680
Shen Wangchen!

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.079
(How could it be?)

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.000
She's fallen for it,
and she won't be able to move for now.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.360
Hurry and catch her.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.360
Mr. Zhen?

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:56.759
Zhen Gui.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.079
I heard there's been some evil demon

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.001
in the city again.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.279
Find out
that demon's whereabouts immediately.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.160
Well, Young Madam,

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.240
just what's the matter

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.319
with Young City Lord?

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.759
You must hang in there.

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.360
You have our support,

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:12.439
so don't ever give up.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.160
Why?

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.399
Shen Wangchen and his family

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.120
have been treating you well.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.519
They're treating me well?

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680
I have

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.399
dedicated half of my life

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.639
to Moyuan City.

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.080
But what have I received in return?

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.840
All the glory

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.759
belongs to the Shen family!

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.640
The City Lord had been muddle-headed
and sheltering his people.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.720
Before his departure,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.279
he still insisted on making

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.240
his badly sick son

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.960
the next City Lord.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.879
That is unfair to me!

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.120
The Shen family
is nothing but incompetent.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.879
I should be

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.639
the City Lord instead!

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000
Now that

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.919
Shen Wangchen is gone,

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:10.200
I'm blessed enough

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.600
to have the goods on them.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.039
Tonight,

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.000
I shall eradicate the Shen family

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.559
after dealing with you.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.120
Shen Wangchen.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:25.720
Evil demon.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.919
You will meet your demise today.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:29.840
Do it!
