[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.830
[Episode 2]

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.710
You promised

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.400
to crack the case in three days.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.200
And what happened?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.400
Our Grand Secretary

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.350
was stabbed to death on the street!

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.400
Is this what you're capable of,
King Zhong of Constables?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.330
Is this the best
your Elite Constabulary Unit can do?

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.509
Your Majesty,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.039
Xiao Beiming from the
Elite Constabulary Unit seeks an audience.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.760
Good timing. Let him in.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.310
Let me see

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.770
how he'll explain it to me.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.870
Xiao Beiming!

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.690
You have to be held accountable

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.400
for Mr. Shen's death.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.520
Today, I'll

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.120
let you die a decent death.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.190
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.520
What do I mean?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.810
Don't you know

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.150
Mr. Shen was stabbed
to death on the street?

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.950
Your Majesty,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.960
Mr. Shen

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.150
wants to brief you on this in person.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560
Mr. Shen?

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.960
Mr. Stranger,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.700
let's make a deal.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.360
I had someone make a skin-like mask

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.750
that was so real.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.910
The one who died in the carriage

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.190
was a prisoner on death row
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.360
I planned to capture Yesha

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.400
by this means.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.420
But I didn't expect us
to be back empty-handed.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.420
But Xiao Beiming,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.130
you promised to make progress

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.310
on the case within three days.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.120
Now time's up.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.000
You'd better give me

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.600
a proper explanation today.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.560
I am going to report
to you, Your Majesty, the truth

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.630
behind the statue's tears of blood

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.800
and the deaths of the three ministers.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.570
Stand up and continue.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.280
Master.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.960
Zhong, you can stand up as well.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.800
Master.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.840
Let me start
with the statue's tears of blood.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
Your Majesty, you asked

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.310
someone to wipe away
the tears of blood on the statue,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.560
but I still spotted traces,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.400
as there's no perfect crime.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.360
The so-called tears of blood

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.860
turned out to be a special wax.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.090
[Phoenix Wax]

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.120
There is something called Mara Candle.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.870
It's a kind of sacrificial item
commonly used

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.960
in the alien temples,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.710
rarely seen in the Central Plains.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.030
The wax has no color at room temperature.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.400
But once it's heated up,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.630
it'll soon melt and turn

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.000
into red liquid wax.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.400
So it's also known as Phoenix Wax,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.840
referring to the phoenix's
rebirth through flames.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.840
Before the ritual,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.400
someone had coated the statue's eyes

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.630
with the Phoenix Wax.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.430
Once the tears of blood flowed,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.430
he just took action to kill

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.560
the stereotype of the statue,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.000
making it look like God's punishment.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.240
Lang Hua Pavilion

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.000
is heavily guarded.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.310
How did

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.630
the perpetrator

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.240
sneak in and apply the wax?

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.000
He didn't need to sneak into it.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.830
He could bribe

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.190
the eunuch guarding Lang Hua Pavilion.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.310
I think the eunuch didn't expect

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.560
this would turn into such a big deal.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.920
When I found him,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.480
he had committed suicide out of fear.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.830
Or maybe he was killed by the Yesha.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.510
Then my three assistant ministers

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.600
died mysteriously.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.750
How do you explain that?

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.390
I'll start with Mr. Lu.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.040
At the spot where Lord Lu was murdered,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.750
I noticed the traces of silk thread

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.680
binding the trees
on both sides of the road.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.560
I deduce that

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.830
Mr. Lu rode on the horse

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.000
at high speed and crashed

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.090
into the silk thread

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.480
fastened by the murderer in advance.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.750
So it cut his throat.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.310
This is no ordinary thread.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.510
It's called Melted-in-Blood Thread,

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.560
made by a sect

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.190
in the martial world.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.240
This is a super tough thread,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.920
yet it melts immediately in blood.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.700
In the forest,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.920
it looks just like some normal cobwebs

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.510
without arousing people's attention.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.560
Then what about Mr. Qin and Mr. Fan?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.750
Mr. Qin suddenly caught fire

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.390
because someone had put

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.670
a special fuel

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.160
on his clothes,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.000
which contained nitre.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.800
Mr. Qin was short-sighted.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.000
He was always close to the candle

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.750
when writing memorials.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.190
It lit up his clothes.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.750
Propelled by the special fuel,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.550
he burned to ashes in an instant.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.320
The taste of nitre is bitter and salty.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.160
[Yesha]

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.920
We could tell by taste.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.430
Mr. Fan has facial ulcers.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.510
It's itchy.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.310
He used to wash his face
with medicine every day.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.720
The bad of medicine was not poisonous.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.000
But there was a wrong dosage of one herb.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.750
The herb is called wolfsbane.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.190
Normally, one wolfsbane should be enough.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.510
But there were five

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.110
in the medicine bag that day.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.920
Excessive wolfsbane toxin

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.040
infiltrated into his body
through the ulcers.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.680
It paralyzed Mr. Fan,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.120
making him unable to get up

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.390
until he drowned in the basin.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.180
The word "Yesha" on the mirror

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.430
[Yesha]

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.270
had been written with acid in advance.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.360
It just revealed itself

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.800
when it met hot vapour.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.390
I see.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.130
Then have you found out

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.330
the man's identity?

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.240
Though Yesha broke my trap,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.360
I will figure out

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.160
his identity soon.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.630
Since he broke your trap,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.720
what makes you so sure that

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.540
you'll find out

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.430
his identity?

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.680
Because his breaking

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.610
of this trap is also part of my plan.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.480
I did allow you to use four carriages

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.510
to confuse Yesha,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.950
but how dare you use the prisoners

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.830
on death row
to set up a trap without my permission?

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.600
Tell me

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.800
how dare you?

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.360
Master, please calm down.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.390
Those four committed heinous crimes

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.480
beyond any chance of redemption.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.330
Being used as bait

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.290
to save Mr. Shen's life,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.560
they just died in a meaningful way.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.510
You jerk!

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.320
Even if they were convicted,

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.600
the verdicts could still be

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.870
overturned before the executions.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.720
Who gave you the right

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.040
to take someone's life?

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.750
Do you still

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.360
have respect for the laws?

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:47.560
Master,

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:50.360
I think when there is a reasonable way,

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.390
we should adopt it.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.390
To be constrained by rules

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.510
is to bind your own hands.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:54.830
Special moves for special cases.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.070
How can we solve cases and arrest Yesha

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.000
if we stick to the old rules?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.600
You...

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.830
I-I'll beat you up!

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.670
Master! Master! Wait!

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.070
[Self-disciplined & Loyal]

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.070
I didn't tell you

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.510
because I knew you might oppose this plan.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.580
The situation was urgent.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.360
I had to bet on it,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.000
and I pulled it off.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.160
His Majesty didn't blame us.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.070
Yesha also fell for the trick.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.920
Our priority now

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.600
is to capture Yesha

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.040
instead of arguing here.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.070

[Dignified & Upright]

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.180
Are my father and Beiming in there?

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.680
You can't go in now.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.070
Since their return
from the imperial palace,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.360
our master has pulled a long face.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.670
I think the two of them are quarrelling.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:27.480
What?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.830
You're too arrogant in handling cases.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.630
I'm afraid you'll pay

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.000
for your arrogance one day.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.120
You're still young,

and you're going to marry Xueman soon.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.120
I don't want you to go astray

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.180
and regret it in the future, you know?

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.360
Master,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.750
you raised me up

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.750
and taught me skills.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.830
You've done so much for me.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.920
And you're like

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.000
a real father to me.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.510
I will never disobey you.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.310
If you think I did it wrong,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.310
after we close this case

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.360
and catch Yesha,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.000
I will ask for your forgiveness.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.159
You can punish me

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.510
as you like.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.800
Forget it.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.070
As the saints say,

no intervention when one hasn't

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.390
personally experienced it.

Only after

will you remember to be cautious.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.800
Let's put this aside

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.160
and talk about it
after the case is solved.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.220
Thank you, Master.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.750
Master.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.870
In the imperial palace, you said

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.870
you deliberately let Yesha break the trap

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.909
to find out his identity.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.039
What does that mean?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.440
When I found out

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.600
how the three ministers died,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.960
I just realized Yesha's identity

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.000
must be special.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.669
The daily habits

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.390
and routines of the three ministers

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.270
should be top secret,

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.080
definitely not something
an ordinary man could know.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.360
So I suspect...

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.720
You suspect Yesha is
from the imperial court?

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.480
Yes.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.080
But the court officials are numerous.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.550
We must narrow down the scope.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.550
So I used the four carriages

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.150
coming out of Shen's mansion

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.010
to set up a trap.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.390
In the name of seeking help,

00:08:59.390 --> 00:08:59.960
I informed

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.790
the four capable suspects
in the imperial court

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.030
of the fake information—

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:04.870
Mr. Shen's existence
in one of the four carriages.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.360
But something went wrong

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.510
only in the carriage I was escorting.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.770

in the martial world.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.960
Since Yesha has so many weird

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.840
and unusual tools for committing crimes.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.070

This is not the way of moves I taught you.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.630
You're taking a risky move this time.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.320

It's a chess game.

Yesha's identity.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.200
He is no match for me.

Why can't I be there tomorrow?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.800
Because you yearn to beat him too much.

you're outdoing me, your master.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.120
Then you should take me with you tomorrow.

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.510
That's why

is not to defeat you.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.000
I don't get it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.600
Yesha is way more atrocious

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.630
than any other rivals

Your pride and restlessness

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.450
can be your biggest weakness.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.120
You seem to get the upper hand now.

But how do you know

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.590
he has no backup plan?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.790
What if

he deliberately

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.270
let you gain this advantage?

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.240
Once you are utilized
and controlled by him,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.950
the consequences will be devastating.

Why are you still in red today?

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.270
I can wear

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.080
whatever I like.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.200
It's none of your business.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.130
Horseman Zhuge,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.720
today is my wedding.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.030
I'd like to hear something
auspicious from you.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.480
We haven't caught Yesha yet.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.280
Don't get carried away too soon.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.480
Double blessings!

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.290
You're lucky to witness them!

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.550
Mr. Zhong, congratulations.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.080
We're honored to be the witnesses

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.000
-at your daughter's wedding.
-Congratulations, Mr. Zhong.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.080
I'm so honored.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.960
I'm flattered.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.090
Your attendance

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:45.570
is already a big help to me.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.790
It's my honor!

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.800
I heard that you dote
on your daughter so much.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.000
She's getting married today.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.080
Mr. Zhong, I wonder

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:54.150
if you're feeling bittersweet now.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.080
Yes, I am.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.670
My daughter has been naughty
since childhood.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.960
Now that someone is going to marry her,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.080
I've got rid of

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.240
one of my worries.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.320
But Mr. Zhong,

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.550
isn't it a bit over the top to hold

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.480
your daughter's wedding

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.110
at the Dingfeng Pavilion?

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.480
People outside

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.270
might think that
your Elite Constabulary Unit

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.360
is carrying out a special operation.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.600
Your plan

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.200
will put everyone there

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.440
in danger!

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.240
If they run into danger,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.360
what can you do?

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.600
With a meticulous plan,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.120
I'm confident that I can keep

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.790
all the guests safe and sound.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.750
Deputy Chief Fang,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.600
this is the Yulin Commander,

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.960
General Huo Zongyao.

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.200
Thank you, General,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.240
for coming to help today.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:47.390
Greetings, General Huo.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.320
Mr. Zhong, don't mention it.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.840
This is something serious.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.030
Tell me your plan.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.480
Beiming

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:59.030
Beiming is my disciple,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.360
not a matrilocal bridegroom.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.200
We can't hold the wedding
in our own mansion.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.550
So we had to choose

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.240
a beautiful venue.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.440
That makes sense.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.840
It's the auspicious time!

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:09.360
Yes.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.240
It's time!

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.240

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.080

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.510

Master has always been calm and composed.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:59.440
Yesterday, it was

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.700
my first time
to see that look on his face.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.030

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.070

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.480

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.070
I've deposited

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.640
all our family's property

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.830

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.880
You can withdraw it

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.440

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:35.290

to give you a comfortable life.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.070
Dad...

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.200
Listen.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.200
You know what?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.030
For a girl to be fearless,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.720
she must have money.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.310
Come on.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:54.000
Let Dad hug you for one more time.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.260
Seeing you get married

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.640
is

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.310
an immense relief for me.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:06.960

we will both rest in peace.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.720
He gave me this ring yesterday,

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.640
saying it is my dowry.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.030
But it sounded more like
a parting gift.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.830
It's said that Fengbo Lake
is a must-visit locale

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.830
for visitors to Dingfeng Pavilion.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.520
Such beautiful scenery

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.630
is unparalleled in the capital.

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:31.950
You're right, Mr. Mei.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.720
I have got

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.350
an itinerary planned out.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.170
We'll board a boat later.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.750
Having a feast on the lake
in this lovely spring day

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.010
will be a joy, won't it?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.440
Mr. Zhong, no need to rush.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.640
Let's first tour around

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.030
this beautiful place.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.030
Then,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.950
we'll taste a nice cup of tea.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.200
What do you think?

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.640
Good idea, Mr. Miao.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.310
Okay.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.170
Beiming,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.400
I'll go with you

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.160
to help Dad catch Yesha.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.810
Sorry, Xueman.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.590
I promised Master

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.970
to always keep you safe.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.550
Don't try to break the acupoint seal
with internal energy.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.620
Or you'll get hurt.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:29.160
Wait for me to come back.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.590
Gentlemen,

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.720
please get on the boat.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.150
Sure.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:32.680
This way.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.000
After you.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.460
Thanks.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.680
Hold on, gentlemen!

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.200
Here comes the groom.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.510
Dad.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.640
What brings you here?

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.400
I'd like to keep you
and the guests company

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.770
on the boat trip.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.070
You should be with Xueman

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.030
in the room now.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.790
It was Xueman who told me to come.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.480
Seeing our guests'
undiminished excitement,

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.160
she asked me to show proper courtesy.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.830
Look,

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.550
I'm here with the guests now.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:56.960
How is it not proper courtesy?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:57.590
Besides,

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.830
this is your and Xueman's wedding.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.830
Our guests will show some understanding,

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.750
right?

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.160
Off you go.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.200
Dad, I...

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.240
Beiming, listen to me.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.350
Just go.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.350
Mr. Zhong,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.740
this is a kind gesture of the groom's.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:17.880
The bride has also approved of it.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.710
Why not

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.610
let him join us for the boat trip?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.010
It won't take much time.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.000
Maybe his presence

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.790
can bring us good luck.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:25.830
That's right.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.590
The groom has solved many difficult cases.

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.720
I've been curious about them

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.070
for a long time.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.720
This is a good opportunity
to pick his brain.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.110
Sounds nice.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.110
How lucky to have a dialogue
with the groom.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.350
Attending

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.000
this wedding is truly rewarding.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.080
What useful insights

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.400
can an ignorant young man offer?

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.030
What's more,

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.270
today is his wedding day.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.030
He should be with the bride instead,

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.400
right?

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.720
Beiming,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.750
leave now.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.880
Mr. Zhong,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.810
you keep declining him.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.920
Is there a secret
hidden behind the boat trip?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.420
Mr. Zhong, just speak your mind.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.830
No need for diplomatic parlance.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.030
Mr. Zhong,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.840
are you hatching a conspiracy?

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.240
-Listen to yourself.
-You must be kidding, gentlemen.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.030
My father-in-law cares a lot about Xueman.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.080
He hates the idea of her being alone
on her wedding day.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.440
Thank you all for the invitation.

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.640
I'm glad to take this boat trip with you.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:26.880
Master,

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.270
could you please let me get on the boat

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.550
with these gentlemen?

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.400
Now that our guests

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.930
have kindly invited you...

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.030
Fine.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.320
You can join us.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.610
Thank you, Master.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.000
Beiming,

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.750
-I heard you solved many peculiar cases.
-This way.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:48.280
What a marvelous young man.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:49.160
I must

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.200
have drinks with you.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.680
Sure.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.880
We aim to get drunk today.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.350
This way.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.950
[Dossier of Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.720
Ridiculous.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.170
This is ridiculous!

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.550
How dare you suspect
one of us to be Yesha?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.240
Is this

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.700
how you entertain guests?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.830
It seems like

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.290
we are unable to leave now.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.030
How bold of the Elite Constabulary Unit!

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.030
How dare you confine us officials here?

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.960
I will report this to His Majesty!

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.480
Zhong Yunchi,

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.830
punishment awaits you!

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.000
Officers, please calm down.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.730
Do you think we'd have the guts

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.650
to arrange this
without His Majesty's permission?

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:33.830
What?

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.310
This is His Majesty's order?

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.470
Officers, no need to panic.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.030
As long as

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:45.590
you cooperatively receive

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.030
some inquiries,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.960
help us identify Yesha

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.590
and rid Qi Kingdom of a menace,

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:52.640
I will pay visits to you

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.880
and apologize in person

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.080
after catching this hateful offender.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:03.590
Please.

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.120
According to the dossier,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.870
you narrowed down the suspects

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.550
to the three of us

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.550
through the carriage stratagem.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.110
Am I right?

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.920
Yes.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.830
Mr. Mei,

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.160
do you have any questions?

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.350
No, I dare not.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.830
But I'm sure there are

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.750
other suspects besides us.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.830
If those who knew

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:29.790
Mr. Shen's whereabouts

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.590
are suspects,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.780
then among us on this boat,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.530
King Zhong of Constables
and Constable Xiao—

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.110
who made that plan—

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.350
must be included too.

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.030
Suppose you were right,
then why would Master and I

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.030
have solved the previous three cases

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.590
and gone to extraordinary lengths

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.240
to lure Yesha out?

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.400
A thief playing innocent.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.750
Quite a common kind of ruse, isn't it?

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.290
The blood-like tears on the statue...

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.820
The causes of
the three officials' deaths...

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.350
Anyone could've made all those happen

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:07.200
with proper methods.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.400
That's right.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.000
Mr. Yin

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.230
has close bonds with the martial world,

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.230
so he knows of certain killing methods

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.590
and novel devices.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.790
But as I recall,

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:20.940
only after learning about those tricks

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.070
were you able to solve the cases.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.440
Can anyone tell

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.830
who got the information first,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.240
you or Mr. Yin?

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.070
That's true.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:29.510
Minister Miao

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.000
could find out

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.960
the three officials' daily routines
and life habits.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.040
Wouldn't it also be easy

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.680
for the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.920
to discover those facts?

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.270
How interesting.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.060
About the assassination of Mr. Shen,

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.790
we were indeed told in advance

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.830
about which carriage he would be on.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.110
So were you two.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.030
Mr. Shen was injured by a hidden weapon

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.270
within the carriage.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.160
Yesha didn't show up at all.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.350
As far as I know,

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:58.270
King Zhong of Constables is an expert

00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.440
in hidden weapons.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.720
The dossier says

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.510
that the prisoner died on a carriage.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.550
You, Constable Xiao, were

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.160
with him on that carriage.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.920
There were no other witnesses.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.590
Who can prove that the prisoner was killed

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:14.550
by a hidden weapon
coming through the window,

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.640
or

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.550
by someone around him?

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.510
Everyone here

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.010
is a suspect.

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.640
But only one can be Yesha.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.720
Although I’m not good at

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.160
solving cases,

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.640
I do have some theories

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.550
about Yesha's identity.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.160
What I've seen today

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.720
has confirmed

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.350
my speculation.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.640
Mr. Miao,

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:39.550
do you know

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.510
who Yesha is?

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.030
Minister Miao,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.480
what are you trying to say?

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.830
Zhong Yunchi,

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.570
when will you shed your facade?

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.480
Mr. Miao,

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.710
don't talk nonsense.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720
King Zhong of Constables

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.550
is a law-abiding officer

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.240
who never would defy rules.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.310
That is known to all officials.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:21.960
Today,

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.510
you tricked us into getting on this boat,

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.000
though you had no evidence.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.310
You've even set up an ambush,

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.830
which might end our lives.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.830
Is this how you usually solve cases,

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.290
King Zhong of Constables?

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.680
You're clearly trying to

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.640
silence us forever.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.240
You...

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.070
Your plan is to kill us first,

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:40.690
and then accuse one of us

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720
on the boat

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.110
to be Yesha.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:44.960
You can say the others

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.420
unfortunately died when they fought Yesha.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.550
That will be your way out.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.030
Constable Xiao,

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.000
why did your master

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.800
refuse to let you board the boat?

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.400
Because

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.320
he didn't include you in his plan!

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.030
Am I right,

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.350
King Zhong of Constables,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.640
Zhong Yunchi?

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.240
Or should I call you

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.750
Yesha?

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.680
Nonsense!

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.310
My master invited you for this boat trip

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:16.700
just to find out who Yesha is.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.930
He has never thought of framing

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.160
or harming anyone!

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:22.680
Well,

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.510
let me tell you another story then.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:25.640
Mr. Miao,

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.000
tread lightly,

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.160
or you might reach a point of no return.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.180
I'm already on the boat.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:34.490
I know there is no going back.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200
What story?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.410
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.270
King Zhong of Constables,

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:52.480
I think you know

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.030
this story better than I do.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.240
Up till now,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.350
I bet Constable Xiao still hasn't realized

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.640
that you actually know

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.440
what "Yesha" truly stands for.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.160
Have you never told him

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.330
the truth

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.450
because you don't want him to know

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.710
what you did years ago?

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.310
Yesha,

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:12.840
confess you are guilty!

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.480
Do you want me to continue?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:34.650
Oh no.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.120
Something happened!

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.680
Dad...

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.000
Dad!

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.190
Take him down!

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.550
