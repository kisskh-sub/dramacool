=Episode 12=

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.560
All right.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.560
Let's hear your plan.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.959
Your Highness genuinely cares
about the world.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.400
Lately, Moyuan City has been saturated
with a demonic presence…

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.120
Enough.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.359
I don't care

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.640
about the fate of the world.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.640
All I want is Shen Wangchen.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.280
If that's the case,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.680
then it's simple.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.879
It's you.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.439
What are you doing in Moyuan City?

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.319
None of your business.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.479
Look who's talking.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.960
Why were you on the roof

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.439
of Shen Wangchen's house?

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.840
I'm here to catch demons.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.479
That's laughable.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.000
This is Shen Wangchen's home.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.039
Where are the demons?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.660
- Don't tell me…
- Don't tell me…

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:23.599
100 years ago,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.840
demon slayers battled the Cat Demon
for a long time

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.800
and finally defeated her by the sword.

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:29.280
She destroyed her demon core

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:30.680
and turned to ash.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.400
(You)

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.719
(are that Cat Demon.)

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.639
(I don't understand.)

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.360
(I know she's a demon now,)

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.280
(but why do I find it even harder
to strike her down?)

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.360
(What defines)

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.879
(good and evil?)

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.810
(It seems I still haven't fully grasped)

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:12.599
(the notion)

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.120
(of right and wrong.)

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.480
Did you go after the Cat Demon?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.040
I was incompetent.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.720
I failed to catch the Cat Demon

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.360
and even soiled the geomantic compass.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:16.600
What happened?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.160
I ran into human traffickers.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.079
I got hurt while rescuing a child.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.000
Once the compass is stained with blood,

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.519
it will only point to the blood's owner
for seven days.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.360
Never mind.

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.279
Go treat your wounds.

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:37.560
Understood.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.279
Master,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.560
according to the servants,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.360
Young Madam has been

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.319
acting strange lately.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.839
Someone saw her drinking water

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.600
with her tongue.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.519
She also likes to fish

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:03.040
in your koi pond.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.160
Qianchun Mountain has fewer

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.120
than 20 hunting families.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.720
None with the surname Fan,
as far as we know.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.839
Dear,

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.759
that is peculiar indeed.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.399
All right, all right.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:14.959
I will investigate this matter.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.920
Zhen Gui,

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.800
there's another urgent task

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.199
I need you to handle.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.560
Rumor has it a vicious demon

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.480
has been spotted again inside the city.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.319
Every place it visits,

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.680
no one survives.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.079
The people are terrified.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:32.000
It looks like trouble is brewing
in the city again.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:34.360
Find this demon's whereabouts

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.480
and report to me.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.399
Why are you standing there? Go!

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:50.120
Though Qianchun Mountain
is sparsely populated,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.000
demons abound.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.439
Dear, you mean…

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:59.519
Chen has genuine feelings for her.

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:02.279
Don't spread this

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.439
until we know the full truth.

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:04.560
Otherwise,

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.279
it could hurt them both.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.519
All right.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.759
What's this blackened thing?

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.920
Is that a charcoal stick?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.879
People say it tastes good.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:20.519
Who said that?

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:21.920
If you make anyone sick,
you'll pay for it!

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.040
It looks fine to me.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.439
It's all burnt to charcoal!

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:25.079
Who would eat

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.319
something that black?

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:27.839
They're eating it.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:28.279
They eat it?

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:29.120
If they get sick, you'll pay!

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.399
Ever since Chief Fan showed up,

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:32.480
the red beans are being used up
faster than ever.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.480
If this keeps up,

00:07:34.079 --> 00:07:35.790
we'll have to start buying them
from outside the city.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.079
It's perfectly fine!

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:48.639
Jiang Li?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.360
I finally found you, Jiang Li!

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.240
They won't even let me fish anymore.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.559
Fishing like this takes forever…

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.240
Dayao!

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:38.159
Quiet. I'm fishing.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.919
Momo?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:45.879
Momo!

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:47.480
Dayao!

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.320
Oh,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.720
I missed you so much!

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.960
What are you doing here?

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.360
It's a long story.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.759
You can move in and tell her everything later.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.519
Right.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:57.039
Come on.

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:57.759
I'll give you a tour.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:58.039
All right.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.000
You managed to get here on your own.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.759
Impressive.

00:08:59.759 --> 00:09:00.879
I'm amazing, aren't I?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.240
Not bad.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.000
Dayao.

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:09.559
You two go on ahead.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.279
All right.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.320
Let's go.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.279
Come on.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.799
What is it?

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:15.480
Do you remember I told you

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:16.679
there's a hidden hand

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.080
stirring trouble behind the scenes,

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.120
deliberately causing chaos

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.279
to pit humans and demons

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:21.799
against each other?

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.200
I've decided to take action

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.600
and unravel their scheme piece by piece.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.120
During this time,

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.840
it might be dangerous
for you and Rong Momo

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.960
to stay in the city.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.679
Why don't you both

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:30.879
go back to the fort

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.799
for a while?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:33.919
Dangerous?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.279
Moyuan City?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.759
If you hadn't stopped me

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:38.879
from acting,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.480
I'd crush

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.600
those puny humans

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.799
like ants.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.399
You worry too much.

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:46.799
Besides,

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.960
you said

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.440
this is your territory.

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:50.919
You'll protect me.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.200
I'm afraid

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.720
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.480
What does that mean?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.080
I don't want to study today.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.919
I'm off to play with Rong Momo.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.360
Momo!

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.080
Dayao!

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.600
I'll show you

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.159
something amazing!

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:12.840
All right!

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.159
Listen,

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.639
there's a little girl
who raises rabbits here,

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.919
and she idolizes me.

00:10:20.919 --> 00:10:21.480
So,

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.720
humans aren't so bad after all.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.519
They admire us demons.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.879
So, humans

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:27.080
treat you well then?

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.679
Very well.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.840
Everything

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.960
requires strategy.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.639
I mean,

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.960
my alliance with Shen Wangchen

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.039
worked perfectly.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.440
Dayao,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.600
is your relationship with Mr. Shen

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.240
just an alliance?

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.519
Of course.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.000
And a very close one at that.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.799
Whenever I find something tasty,

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.080
he's the first to try it.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.000
When I find something fun,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.600
he's the first one I tell.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.039
Every night when we part,

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:48.919
I feel

00:10:48.919 --> 00:10:50.200
so empty inside.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.279
I can't wait for morning to come.

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.879
He suggested I leave here just now.

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:54.960
How could I?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.320
I'd be heartbroken.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.919
Dayao,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.200
that's not strategy.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.120
That's love.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.912
♪How do you measure one's concern?♪
