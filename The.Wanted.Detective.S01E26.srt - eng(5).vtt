[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.830
[Episode 26]

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.120
You're awake?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.900
You scared us to death.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.840
Dairong.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.670
Where's Beiming?

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.039
He's been taken
by the Elite Constabulary Unit again.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.190
Take it easy.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.060
You're still very weak.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.140
I need to find him.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.090
Constable Zhong,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.220
where are you going?

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.080
I need to find Beiming.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.400
I'm afraid that's not possible right now.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.360
What do you mean?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.870
Chief Fang has given orders

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.670
that no one is allowed to see him.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.710
Why?

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.360
Huang Wuchang

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.910
died at the worst possible time.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.120
With Huang Wuchang dead,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.920
Beiming's suspicion

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.240
is even harder to clear now.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.590
And that old bastard Zhuge

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.120
keeps watching
the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000
saying he'll report
to the Ministry of Justice

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.190
to co-investigate Beiming.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.870
Chief Fang has no choice in this matter.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.150
Huang Wuchang is dead,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.110
but before he died,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.280
didn't he say Yesha was at Haiya?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.470
You all heard it.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.710
Isn't that proof

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.520
that Beiming isn't Yesha?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.280
You're right,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.360
but at that time,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.800
only the few of us heard it.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.510
Our relationship with Beiming

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.970
is well known to everyone,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.460
so we can't be witnesses.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.650
I still need to find Chief Fang

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.480
and explain everything clearly.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.600
-Constable Zhong.
-Xueman.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.570
Finding Chief Fang now

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.950
won't solve the problem.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.480
Let's think of another way.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.390
-Beiming.
-Beiming.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.510
Beiming!

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.130
It's all right.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.640
Weren't you arrested
by the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.040
and not allowed to leave?

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.240
How come you're here?

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.230
I escaped.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.550
Escaped?

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.740
W-What?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.990
Beiming, are you crazy?

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.640
What happened?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.990
Someone helped me.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.829
Yesha is at Haiya?

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.270
That's what Huang Wuchang told you

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.160
before he died?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.600
I never expected

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.320
Huang Wuchang

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.180
would take his own life like that.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.040
Now that he's dead,

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.440
things are even more complicated.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.300
Now, Zhuge Tong

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.200
is pushing for a joint trial
with the Ministry of Justice.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.860
I've tried my best to delay it,

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.000
but there's no one now

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.640
who can clear your name.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.120
Once convicted,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.390
you'll be beyond salvation.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.880
I understand.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.960
What do you mean?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.320
I'm letting you go.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.590
I've already sent everyone else away.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.560
Letting me go?

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.290
If there's anyone in this world

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.680
who can stop Yesha,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.409
I'm afraid you're the only one.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.440
-But the whole capital...
-Do you remember

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.240
how you tricked Yesha

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.220
with Shen Bi's fake death?

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.030
I'll use the same method.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.510
I'll find a death row prisoner
to replace you.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.800
But that's too risky.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.080
He'll be exposed immediately
during questioning.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.880
I'll report to the Ministry of Justice

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.350
that you've contracted a plague

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.910
and no one can come near you.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.440
Those people

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.120
value their lives too much

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.200
to take such a risk.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.910
However,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.880
this plan won't work for long.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.120
I can only give you

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.950
half a month at most.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.510
If you catch Yesha

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.030
within half a month,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.430
everything will be fine.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.120
This is too dangerous.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.909
If they discover
you've released a key criminal,

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.120
you won't just be dismissed
and investigated.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.590
You'll be executed.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.270
Someone has to

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.440
do something, right?

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:54.760
Xiao Beiming,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.590
I've noticed you're
very much like your Master

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.320
when he was young.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.660
You're equally intelligent.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.030
But you both let your emotions

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.160
get the better of you

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.830
and act recklessly,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.000
often making

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.200
foolish decisions.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.120
He once told me

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.120
that right and wrong
are more important than life and death.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.950
I disagreed.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.200
Because of this,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.710
we often argued.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.590
Now that I'm older,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.540
I've actually started

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.340
to understand him more and more.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.200
I even envy him somewhat.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.360
I've been a coward my whole life.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.880
Trusting you

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.680
is the most daring decision

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.150
I've ever made.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.310
The feeling is quite addictive.

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:46.470
Even if I lose this gamble,

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.060
when I meet your master in the afterlife,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.260
I'll still be able to stand tall

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.950
and tell him

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.590
that I,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.570
Fang Tianzheng,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.200
have lived up to the title of Chief

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.390
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.270
I never thought

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.120
Chief Fang would do something like this.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.560
I knew

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.750
I wasn't wrong about Chief Fang.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.640
Since he's so loyal,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.640
if he's in trouble,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.270
I can risk my life for him once.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.090
Just once?

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.870
Just once.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.170
Right now,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.270
besides Chief Fang,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.070
there are many people behind us.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.140
We will definitely defeat Yesha.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.530
How's the situation outside?

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.830
Huang Wuchang's body

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:41.080
was taken by
the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.630
What about those
remaining Yellow Heaven members?

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.470
They've been arrested.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:44.140
They're still being interrogated.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.160
Scarface's wife and daughter

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.080
have been rescued,

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.470
which proves

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.630
that Scarface was coerced.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.990
What about the pill? How is it?

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.630
The pill?

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.990
The pill was destroyed

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.800
and ruined.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.160
Huang Wuchang used thunder gold
to make the pill,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.800
and Old Bug's body

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.680
also contained thunder gold.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680
I suspect

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.320
the pill Old Bug took

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.320
and the one Huang Wuchang made

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320
are the same type.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.680
If that's the case,

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.800
then the thunder gold in Old Bug's body

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.520
must have come from

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.980
the pill he took at the end.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.110
I still need to examine

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.470
Old Bug's body myself.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.110
The Secret Investigation Unit
still has his body.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.990
That's easy.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.200
I'll figure something out.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.990
Eat more.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.920
If that half-blind Zhuge knew

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.830
that we've been treating

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:25.200
the Secret Investigation Unit
like our own home,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.350
coming and going as we please,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:27.350
his one good eye

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.040
would probably go blind with anger.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.830
If you ask me,

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.800
now that Zhuge Kongyun

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.680
has been released,

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.870
we shouldn't

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.110
go through all the trouble

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.630
of sneaking in anymore.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.630
Have him

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.410
take us inside.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.940
Huh? What are you thinking?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.230
Even if Zhuge Kongyun

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.200
is willing to help us,

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.870
what if Beiming gets discovered entering

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.950
the Secret Investigation Unit?

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.110
What about the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.280
The body needs to be examined.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.680
Just not at the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.590
Beiming, what do you mean?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.440
I don't understand.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.160
Tong Shuang,

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.800
after we finish eating,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:52.870
prepare a carriage for me.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.470
All right.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.470
Miss Huo,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.280
after dinner, please help me

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.350
tell Zhuge Kongyun,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.080
"That place."

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.110
That place?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.350
I'll take you there later.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.990
Let's eat.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.030
Is this the place you mentioned?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.560
You've been meeting

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.350
with Zhuge Kongyun here all along?

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.470
Before the Fengbo Lake case,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.750
I used to come occasionally.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.990
Looks like he's already here.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:15.800
Who's this?

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.230
Didn't you say that Zhuge Kongyun

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.440
once handled a case where

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.710
he used the victim as bait

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:20.970
to lure out the killer?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.750
Later, the victim was so frightened

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.200
that she developed hysteria,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.560
and tragically drowned

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:26.920
during an episode.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.800
Her mother was so devastated

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.880
that she cried until she went blind.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.470
Is this the victim's mother?

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.180
All these years,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:38.460
Zhuge Kongyun has been

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.520
taking care of her.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:40.520
I got it.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.560
I'm almost done.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.380
When did you find out about this?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.520
I discovered it

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.070
by chance a long time ago.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.040
You know how peculiar

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.350
Zhuge Kongyun's temper is.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.680
He absolutely forbade me
from telling anyone.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.320
Have some water too, Mrs. Lin.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.230
Let me fan you.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.350
Is that better?

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.280
Thank you.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.350
Fan yourself instead.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.710
I'm fine.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.440
Mrs. Lin!

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.730
That voice sounds like
Beiming has arrived.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:04.830
Beiming!

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.960
I've come to see you.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.230
Oh, Beiming.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:07.990
Mrs. Lin.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.350
Beiming.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.040
Mrs. Lin,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.710
how have you been?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.040
Good, I'm doing well.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.280
I've asked Kongyun many times,

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.080
but he always tells me

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.690
that you're out catching criminals.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.160
I haven't seen you for so long.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.920
I've been so worried.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.460
You must've been through a lot

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.470
out there all these years.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.390
It's nothing,

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.390
Mrs. Lin. I'm doing fine.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.950
Now that I'm back,

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.210
I'm here to stay.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.200
Good,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.870
good.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:42.520
By the way,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.990
you two must have things to talk about.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.630
I'm a bit tired,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.440
so I'll go rest in my room.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.080
Mrs. Lin.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.750
How about

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.280
I accompany you?

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.710
Who's this stranger?

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.590
Zhong Xueman.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.440
The one you know about.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.590
Really?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:01.710
Miss Zhong,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.560
Beiming's wife?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.750
Beiming told me

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.120
that once he married you

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.510
and brought you home,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.350
he would bring you to see me.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.350
And just like that,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.990
three years have passed.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.280
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lin.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320
But I brought her to see you

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.080
as soon as I returned
to the capital, didn't I?

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.160
Miss Zhong,

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.870
come.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.920
Please come inside.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:25.990
Let's go.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.630
That's nice.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.130
Watch your step.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:40.790
I can't believe Fang Tianzheng

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.250
actually released you.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.230
Chief Fang may be cautious,

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.520
but he's a man of integrity.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:47.320
Thanks

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.050
for not telling Mrs. Lin
about my situation.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.190
If I had known...

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:00.400
If I'd known, I would've
arrested you myself

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.320
and told her

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.260
you died in the line of duty.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680
Miss Zhong.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.560
Those two always mention you.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.160
They haven't said

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.090
anything nice about me, have they?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.870
They speak very highly of you.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:17.750
By the way,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.830
you've been married for so long.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.320
Haven't you thought about having a child?

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:29.090
He's always busy with official duties.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.520
You people

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.560
are different from us

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.520
common folk.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.080
Your hearts

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.440
are always filled with grand matters.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.800
If it's not justice and fairness,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.730
then it's the people of Qi Kingdom.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.630
But then again,

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.110
how can all evil

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.870
possibly be eliminated?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.700
How can all the bad people

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.080
possibly be caught?

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.920
Sometimes,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.200
you even forget

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.030
that you're nothing more

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.160
than children after all.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.080
Don't put all those burdens

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.320
on your own shoulders.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.840
And don't wait until someday

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.230
when you've lost something and regret it

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.680
to realize

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.710
that the people around you

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.280
are the most precious.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.200
If I were to

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.440
arrest you right now,

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.520
would the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.160
be completely done for?

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:38.680
This is indeed

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.740
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.230
Mr. Zhuge,

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.610
you're welcome to try.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.110
Your sarcasm

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.650
is truly irritating.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:57.780
You need my help?

00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.830
Yes.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.160
Old Bug's body?

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.880
Not just that.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.750
Fang Tianzheng

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.920
took the risk to free you.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:14.200
This means you told him

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.520
quite a lot.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.160
But I'm not Fang Tianzheng.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.860
Tell me what you know.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.280
Let's see if you can

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.940
convince me not to arrest you.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.920
Beiming is fortunate

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.550
to have met you.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.040
This boy

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.590
is like cotton wrapped in iron.

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.470
He looks tough on the outside,

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:35.990
but his heart

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.110
is too soft.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.950
As they say, what's too rigid
breaks easily.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.470
If he can't hold on anymore

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.760
and the iron breaks,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.750
that little bit of cotton

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.350
will scatter away.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.040
Miss Zhong,

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.110
you must take good care of him.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.110
Don't let him be too stubborn.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.130
Don't worry, Mrs. Lin.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.560
I'll look after him.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.180
Are you saying

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.260
Yesha wants to use

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.720
the pill that Huang Wuchang
and Old Bug created

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.360
to do something?

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.680
That's why we need to

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.710
examine Old Bug's body quickly

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.080
to confirm my theory.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.470
But the clues from Haiya
are also important.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.350
There are no records

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.470
of the soldiers who served

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.130
in the Canfeng Army back then.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.230
Huo Zongyao's case

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.920
left behind many clues

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.350
because he once held

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.470
an important position in the military.

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:38.560
This indicates that someone

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.000
in the court
is connected to the Canfeng Army.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.630
That's right,

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.160
and that's why I came to you.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.280
You want me to help you find out

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.110
if there's anyone else who knows about

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.280
the Haiya clues?

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:48.920
With my current status,

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.510
investigating would be very difficult,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:51.830
with obstacles everywhere.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.360
After much consideration,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.280
I believe you're the most suitable person.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:01.670
I can help you.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.900
However,

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.490
I've saved you so many times

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.829
Do you plan on

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.630
continuing to owe me this favor?

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.630
Mr. Zhuge,

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.910
what do you want?

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.490
The day we catch Yesha

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.349
and your name is cleared,

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.109
I want you to hold my horse

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.670
and announce to the world

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.310
that I, Zhuge Kongyun,

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.990
am better than you, Xiao Beiming.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.319
I am the greatest detective in Qi Kingdom.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.040
Agreed?

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.240
Mr. Zhuge,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.440
without your help these past years,

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:35.670
I wouldn't have made it this far.

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.120
The title of greatest detective
in Qi Kingdom

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.830
has long been rightfully yours.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.880
Cut the flattery.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.350
I'm asking if you agree or not?

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.080
Fine.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.630
Alright,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.320
I'll be waiting for that day.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.910
I'll arrange for you
to examine the body as soon as possible.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.240
As for the Haiya clues,

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.300
just wait for news.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:02.800
About Mrs. Lin...

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.560
After I catch Yesha,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.090
I'll ask Xueman
to keep it a secret for you.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.080
This is my first time

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.150
examining a corpse in a carriage.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.040
We need to hurry.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.870
Zhuge Kongyun only gave us

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.830
two hours

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.320
and we need to return
the body after examination.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.080
Understood.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.320
Any findings?

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.000
Just as we suspected,

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.350
besides the thunder gold,

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.810
there's also red crystal.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.520
How come

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.110
Old Bug's heart is so swollen?

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.080
Xueman said

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:51.010
on the day that Old Bug died,

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.480
after taking the pill...

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.150
His internal energy was so strong

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:57.800
that he could injure her
with a single strike.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.770
Old Bug wasn't skilled in martial arts.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.320
If he could possess enough power

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.080
to overpower Constable Zhong

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.670
after taking this pill,

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.960
and if this pill were mass-produced,

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.320
wouldn't it cause chaos
throughout the land?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:06.910
This is likely

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.150
Yesha's plan.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.240
Wait.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.870
Old Bug's heart

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.190
is so swollen like this.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.280
Even if someone briefly possessed

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.240
such power,

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.320
their heart would rupture

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.040
and they would die shortly after.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.590
Even if the pill could be mass-produced,

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.520
they wouldn't cause much trouble.

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.320
I suspect this pill is still incomplete.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.670
That's why Huang Wuchang
forced Tong Shuang

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:24.720
to take the pill

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:25.960
that day on the mountaintop.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.800
It was to verify

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.960
the pill's potency.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.350
But Old Bug understood pharmacology.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.110
This pill is still a prototype.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.010
Its toxicity is severe,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.110
and no antidote can reverse it.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.560
He knew that after taking it,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.870
he would certainly die shortly after,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.800
even if he could temporarily escape.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.150
Why would he still take it?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.590
That's also

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.870
what's been puzzling me.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.670
Xueman said

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.720
Old Bug rambled incoherently

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.040
before he died.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.650
Looks like we'll need to visit Haiya.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.190
[Wu Zhui fell ill. His Majesty ordered him
to heal in the capital's suburbs]

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.960
Wu Zhui?

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.240
Who is Wu Zhui?

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.560
The clues Zhuge Kongyun found

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.590
must be related to the Canfeng Army.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:04.520
Why does the name Wu Zhui

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.430
sound so familiar?

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.670
Of course it's familiar.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:07.430
He's a prominent figure

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.630
in the Qi Kingdom

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:09.960
and one of the people

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.560
I respect most in my life.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.240
Beiming, you know this person?

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.630
He came from humble beginnings,

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.910
yet he possesses an unyielding spirit.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.560
Shortly after passing the imperial exam,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.000
he dared to stand in the imperial court

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.390
and openly declare to the late emperor

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.520
that the national policies
at the time were flawed.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.320
Afterward,
he harshly rebuked court officials,

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.320
saying they couldn't guide
the emperor above,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.350
nor benefit the people below.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.390
He said they weren't earning their keep.

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.430
That's so bold!

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.520
Why didn't the late emperor behead him?

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.490
The late emperor valued talent,

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.940
believing he was just a scholar

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:37.280
who could only talk theory,

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.870
so he sent Wu Zhui
to the army at the border,

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.390
hoping to temper his spirit.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.390
Little did he know,

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.960
Mr. Wu was no mere theorist.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.320
Clad in white, he stayed at the border

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320
for several years,

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.190
never holding a weapon,

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:48.320
and never staining himself with blood.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.480
With just paper and brush,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.830
using brilliant strategies,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.030
he repelled multiple enemy invasions.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.240
That's incredible!

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:55.460
Then his name should be

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.860
on the Lang Hua Pavilion.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.460
After the late emperor passed away,

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.760
he returned to the court.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.520
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.090
Wu Zhui didn't take a position in court.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.110
Instead, he requested

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.080
to carry the royal staff

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.480
and serve as an envoy
to foreign countries.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.670
He traveled
the Western Regions for many years,

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.570
secretly resolving countless conflicts

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.010
for the Qi Kingdom.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.190
He's truly a legend.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.050
Zhuge Kongyun mentioned in his letter

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:17.350
[Wu Zhui fell ill. His Majesty ordered him
to heal in the capital's suburbs]

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.870
that Wu Zhui fell seriously ill
six months ago.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.630
His Majesty ordered him
to return to the capital to recover,

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:21.620
and he's now staying in

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.110
a farmstead in the suburbs.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.350
Perhaps it was

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.190
his military service at the border

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.110
that aroused Zhuge Kongyun's suspicion

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.510
of him being connected to
the Canfeng Army.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.280
Let's go find him now.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.000
Xueman.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.000
Let me go this time.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.000
How can you go alone?

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.800
Beiming,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.100
if this Mr. Wu

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.560
is truly connected to the Canfeng Army,

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.420
then he likely is

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.860
Yesha's next target.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.240
-Should we…
-What happened to Mr. Shen

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.350
cannot happen again.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.110
If Yesha's men

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:52.280
are still in the capital,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.170
your every move

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:54.590
will be constantly watched.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.480
However, I should

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.480
be in the Elite Constabulary Unit's
prison right now,

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.390
so I'm the most suitable person for this.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:00.240
Besides,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.860
I've recovered from my illness,

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:02.840
and my internal energy is restored.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.060
Even if something happens to me,

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.290
I have ways to escape.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.050
Tong Shuang,

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.610
prepare a carriage for me.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.760
Alright.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.000
Don't worry.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:51.320
Old sir.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.320
Young Master, how can I help you?

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.720
I'm looking for someone.

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.080
Young Master, who are you looking for?

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.760
You.

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:01.190
Mr. Wu.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.630
You've mistaken me for someone else.

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.480
I'm just a farmer.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.390
There's no Mr. Wu here.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.320
Young Master,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.590
it's raining hard.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.030
You should hurry home and take shelter.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.480
I heard that in the Battle of Juyong Pass,

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.390
you were unfortunately hit
in the leg by a stray arrow,

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.650
leaving you disabled.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.810
I saw you walking just now.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.440
You must've injured your right leg.

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.520
Ordinary farmers
have calluses on their hands,

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.390
but mostly between
the thumb and index finger,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.630
while yours are on your fingertips.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.520
This comes from years of holding a brush

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.370
to write.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:44.430
Moreover,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.160
that murderous aura you carry

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:48.650
cannot be concealed

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:49.980
by that straw raincoat.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.910
Who are you,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.830
and what do you want with me?

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:01.390
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.760
I'm a constable from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.190
I have important matters to discuss.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.960
Mr. Wu,

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.890
please find a quiet place
where we can talk in detail.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.960
With such observation
and deduction skills,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.000
you must not be an ordinary person.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.280
Coincidentally,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.590
of all young people of the Qi Kingdom

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.720
that I know of,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.390
only two possess such skills.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.520
One is the son of the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.580
known as Qi Kingdom's top detective.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.190
The other is the disciple
of the King of Constables

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.720
and is now Qi Kingdom's
most wanted criminal.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.080
You just displayed

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.320
the token of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.760
so you must not be

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.590
from the Zhuge family.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.320
Mr. Wu, you're indeed impressive.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.150
I am Xiao Beiming.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:54.590
Sit.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:56.720
At this moment,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.390
you should be in prison.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.500
It seems the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.590
has had some serious trouble.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.800
It's a long story.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.240
I've risked coming here

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.560
out of desperation.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.670
Are you here to kill me?

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.760
Mr. Wu, you misunderstand.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.000
It was villains

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.390
who framed me as Yesha.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.630
I've come to you

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.480
to uncover some truths.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:17.870
What truths?

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.210
Haiya.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:33.110
How much do you know?

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.830
Mr. Wu, you must have been

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.150
part of the Canfeng Army

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.430
with my master,

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:40.040
General Huo Zongyao, and Mr. Miao Jie.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.280
I've come to you

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.150
to discover the truth
about the Canfeng Army

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.720
and Haiya.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.910
It seems

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.910
you've uncovered quite a bit.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.800
My old friends

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.520
probably didn't understand

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:10.870
that these matters

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.760
can't be kept a secret

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.830
even if they've died.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.670
Mr. Wu, I...

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.760
I once swore with my life

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.710
that I would never reveal

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.630
anything about Haiya to anyone.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.960
I cannot help you with this matter.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.830
If you are Yesha,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.350
you can take

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:38.670
this old life of mine.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:39.560
Mr. Wu,

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.830
I am not Yesha.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.040
That doesn't matter.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.080
You only have two choices now.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:45.240
Either kill me

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:46.350
or leave.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:47.910
Mr. Wu,

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.240
there's a massive conspiracy behind Yesha.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.670
If his plot succeeds,

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.280
the entire Qi Kingdom will face disaster.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:54.750
Mr. Wu,

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.150
you've devoted yourself to the Qi Kingdom.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:56.850
Surely you don't want

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.960
to see this happen?

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:00.670
Some calamities

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.350
are destined to happen

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.960
and cannot be stopped by human effort.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.160
You think you're investigating a case,

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.150
but you don't realize

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.560
that what you're investigating

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.760
will cause bloodshed

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.020
throughout the Qi Kingdom in the future.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:14.430
In a sense,

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.830
you are no different from Yesha.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:21.720
I don't agree

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.570
with what you said, Mr. Wu.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:24.590
In this world, there are

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.190
no predestined calamities,

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.240
only the treachery of human hearts.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.830
And the only thing

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.490
that can stop it is justice.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.760
All these years,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.870
what has kept me going

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.680
is also the word "justice."

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.520
Mr. Wu,

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.720
I will not kill you,

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.690
but before I find out the truth...

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.680
I will not leave either.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:13.480
Follow me.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:18.350
Mr. Wu,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:20.880
what's the meaning of this?

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.240
I'm putting in poison.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.390
A deadly poison.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.870
In my life, I've faced
countless dead ends,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.670
but I've always found a way out.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.760
This poisoned drink

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.870
is the solution I offer you.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.090
I don't understand.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.080
Although I once swore

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.040
never to reveal Haiya's truth

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.320
to anyone,

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.560
that doesn't include the dead.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.350
If you drink this,

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.350
you'll have about 15 minutes to live.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.390
During this time,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.560
you may ask me

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:54.960
three questions.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.800
If you refuse,

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.280
then I will drink it.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.320
This will spare Yesha the trouble,

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.280
and I can meet your master sooner

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.110
to reminisce about the past.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.020
What do you think?

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.960
From everything you just said,

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.590
I only agree

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.760
that human hearts are treacherous.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.800
Just like how

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.430
I can't verify whether you are

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.630
Yesha or not,

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.150
nor do I wish to.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:22.800
Let's make it simple.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.430
Who lives and who dies

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.060
will be as clear as day.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.590
You have ten counts

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.830
to decide.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.590
Mr. Wu.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:37.040
Ten.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:38.830
Nine.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.830
Eight.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.020
Seven.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.040
Six.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.380
Five.

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.110
Four.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.110
Three.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.120
Two.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.830
One.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.000
What are you doing, young man?

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.870
Will you drink it or not?

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.350
I will...

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.080
drink this.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.160
You really dare to drink it?

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:18.690
But before I drink,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.430
I have three requests.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.020
Consider them my dying wishes.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.540
I hope you will grant them.

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.450
Fine, let's hear them.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.720
First.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:32.530
I hope you will keep your promise.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.590
You must answer my three questions

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.960
without hiding anything.

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.420
That goes without saying.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.800
Second.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.320
After I die,

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.920
please notify Zhong Xueman

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.110
from the Elite Constabulary Unit
to collect my body,

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.000
and ensure my body

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.870
is returned to her intact.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.040
Alright.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.760
Third,

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.040
my investigation

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:56.960
is of utmost importance

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.690
and must remain confidential.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.150
I can die,

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.980
but I cannot allow

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.610
the Elite Constabulary Unit
to be implicated.

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.800
I hope you will keep this secret for me.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:08.870
You're honorable.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240
I promise you.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.080
It's a deal.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:34.640
You don't have much time left.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.340
Ask whatever you want.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.560
Did the Canfeng Army
massacre people in Haiya?

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.150
That year, I was a military advisor

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.350
in the Canfeng Army.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.390
The massacre did happen.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:49.830
I personally

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.810
killed civilians in Haiya too.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.550
Why did the Canfeng Army

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.280
target the civilians of Haiya?

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.110
It's extremely complicated.

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.960
It's a long story.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.430
You don't have enough time

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.830
to hear me finish.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.520
All I can tell you is

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.290
this had to be done.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.400
Those people had to die.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.850
Are there still any Canfeng Army soldiers

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.240
and Haiya orphans

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.390
in the army?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.670
On the 12th bookshelf of

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.390
the Imperial Secretariat's
Heavenly Chamber,

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.560
there's a registry of Haiya orphans.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.830
It documents

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.830
the surviving Canfeng Army soldiers

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:38.280
and the adopted orphans.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.970
I'm telling you this,

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.780
but you'll never be able to find it.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:51.780
I should remind you

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:54.040
that even if you've made records

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.020
of our conversation today,

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:57.890
I'll burn all these scraps

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.330
after your death.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.670
I suggest you save some time

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.240
to leave your last words quickly,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.100
so I can pass them to Zhong Xueman.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.560
What are you doing?

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.060
When the Elite Constabulary Unit's
constables are on missions,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.670
they always carry wax balls

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:18.720
so that in critical moments,

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.980
they can hide important information
inside their bodies.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.040
Some people

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:28.960
also treat it as a will.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:31.430
I've always kept this habit.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.320
Mr. Wu,

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.690
you've been loyal to your principles
all your life.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.160
You won't go back on your word, will you?

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.800
I didn't expect that in just ten counts,

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.730
you'd already devised a strategy.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.440
I have traveled throughout all kingdoms,

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.240
and met countless heroes and talents,

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.350
but today,

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.630
I must admit that you, Xiao Beiming,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.720
have impressed me.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.520
Secrets

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.630
can be buried forever,

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.230
but the truth

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:11.960
cannot.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:24.810
Guards!

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.040
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.190
Go to the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.449
and find Zhong Xueman.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.560
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.710
Secrets can be buried forever,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.560
but the truth cannot.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.670
Yunchi,

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.880
you've trained
a remarkable disciple.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.670
Beiming, you're awake.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.320
How did this happen?

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.580
What exactly happened?

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.310
Xueman,

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.010
how did I get back here?

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.090
Two farmers

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.140
came to the Elite Constabulary Unit
looking for me,

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.310
saying they had urgent business.

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.840
But I never actually saw them.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.110
There was only a carriage,

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:19.920
where I found you unconscious.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.040
You had no injuries,

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.500
so I brought you back here.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.100
Just sit still.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480
I've sent Tong Shuang
to find Feng Qingzhuo.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.810
What on earth happened?

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.560
Madman!

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.110
Madman!

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.710
He's here.

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:30.310
Hurry!

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.710
Beiming.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:32.040
Beiming, you're awake.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.440
He's fine.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.080
Beiming,

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.560
what on earth happened?

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.750
Didn't you go to find Wu Zhui?

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:47.710
Did you meet him?

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:49.750
I did.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.660
But Mr. Wu

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.800
gave me a test.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.880
What test?

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.750
It's a long story.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:57.480
Xueman, I need you

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.310
to go to the Imperial Secretariat

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.880
and retrieve

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.010
something crucial.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.760
Mind the step, Constable Zhong.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:14.010
[Chamber No. 1]

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.080
[Heavenly Chamber]

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.940
Please come in, Constable Zhong.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.590
Don't let anyone in.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.690
Thank you, Constable Zhong.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.570
[Heavenly Chamber]

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.560
If it were me,

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.190
I wouldn't have dared
to drink that poisoned water.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.310
The fact that I'm fine now

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:29.750
proves that Mr. Wu

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.080
has doubts about the Haiya incident,

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.550
and his previous actions

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.190
were just to test me.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:37.190
Facing death to embrace life...

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.360
He used death to test one's heart.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.630
He really is

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.560
a ruthless and unpredictable man.

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.520
That damned Wu Zhui

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.040
actually made you take poison!

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.000
Calm down.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.750
Sit down.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.000
Didn't I test it?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.400
It wasn't poisoned.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.630
But what if it had been?

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.960
Beiming would be dead now!

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.400
I'm fine now, aren't I?

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.520
A test?

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.840
Next time I see him,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.790
I'll give him a couple of punches.

the registry of Haiya orphans

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.740
that Wu Zhui mentioned

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.400
has names we wouldn't expect?
