We couldn't get in at all,

They didn't say a word to us

I can't believe this.

Those two are notorious

for holding grudges,

that someone would come to question me,

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.140
named Huang Wuchang

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.650
who was rescued during transport.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.850
We'd like to inquire about this matter.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.590
And what does that

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.550
have to do with me?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.230
The carrier pigeons used
by the Secret Investigation Unit

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.630
come from your dovecote.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.840
So, you're saying

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.390
that information was leaked

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:15.410
from my dovecote?

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.230
Of course,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.860
we're not suspecting you,
Director Blue Cat.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.850
We both know

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.610
that the dovecote is actually

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:21.780
[Nest of Returning Wings]

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.040
our country's intelligence agency.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.020
And you are

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.320
the director of the agency.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.890
Stealing secrets from the dovecote

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:28.490
would be nearly impossible.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:29.480
But...

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.060
is there a chance that the pigeons

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.490
could be intercepted during delivery?

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.730
Chief Zhuge and his son

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.120
are no ordinary people.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.230
They have their own

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.800
unique methods of sealing messages.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.990
If the messages were opened midway,

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.190
do you think they would not notice?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.430
Our pigeons

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.090
are specially trained.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.180
It would be very difficult

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.330
to tamper with them.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.890
You're overthinking this.

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.950
I suggest that you

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.960
try a different approach
in your investigation.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.540
This topic ends here.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.690
I should go now.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.520
Director Blue Cat,

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.050
since you're already here,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240
why not dine here

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.750
before heading back?

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.960
I've told you everything I can.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.380
The dovecote has strict rules.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.380
My coming to the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:14.640
has already broken them,

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.120
and I've shown enough courtesy.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.360
Chief Fang, please understand.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.220
I understand. I understand.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.530
Director Blue Cat,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.070
Huang Wuchang has committed
numerous crimes

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.370
and must be captured as soon as possible.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.860
Please help us, Director Blue Cat.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.600
This matter doesn't concern me.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.380
I'm only responsible for
gathering intelligence

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.040
and taking care of my pigeons.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.190
Please wait.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.390
Director Blue Cat,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.790
I've heard some fascinating folk tales.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.850
They say that in the eastern seas
of the Qi Kingdom,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.470
there's a small island
with an ancient tribe

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.470
that has lived for generations

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.070
raising and training birds.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.330
The thumbs of their people

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.350
are different from ordinary people'sâ€”

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.210
exceptionally long and slender.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.870
Just now, I noticed that your thumb

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.270
exhibits the same trait.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.710
Could the rumors be true?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.330
That's not just a rumor.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:04.690
I'm indeed a member of
the Bird Tamer Tribe.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.820
So the Bird Tamer Tribe really exists.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.380
What about the Eastern Sea Kingdom?

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.930
They wanted our tribe

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.190
to become their spies,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.940
working exclusively for them.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.530
When we refused,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.490
they slaughtered

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.140
our entire tribe.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.110
I escaped by sheer luck

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.640
and fled to the Qi Kingdom,

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.570
where I've been living ever since.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.700
I see.

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.840
Director Blue Cat,

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.780
may I ask how life is for you here

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.180
in the Qi Kingdom?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.340
Very well.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.000
The imperial court has taken good care
of me,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.840
and I have family and friends now.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.190
Why do you ask?

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.460
Director Blue Cat,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.660
Huang Wuchang is

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.810
a complete madman.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:55.810
We've discovered
that he's been orchestrating

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:56.870
a massive conspiracy.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.470
If his conspiracy succeeds,

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.090
countless people in the Qi Kingdom

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.280
will lose their homes and families.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.650
The common people are innocent.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.700
You've experienced loss,

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.670
so you must understand

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.070
that feeling of despair.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.290
Director Blue Cat,

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.660
please, for the sake of

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.460
all the people of the Qi Kingdom,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.780
help us.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.330
Fine.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:26.550
I admit

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.060
that I did keep something from you.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.670
Actually,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.690
the dovecote keeps a copy

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.820
of everything written on the messages

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.330
delivered by the pigeons.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.510
In other words,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:39.940
if I wish to,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.680
I can know everything.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.370
But didn't you say
that many pigeon messages

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.040
are sealed in special ways?

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.600
We have techniques passed down
through generations

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.930
that allow us to view
the contents of messages

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.460
without leaving any trace.

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.950
Don't misunderstand.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.070
That's the Intelligence Agency's duty.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.740
The monitoring is to

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.680
prevent greater disasters.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.160
The imperial court permits this

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:01.940
because Director Blue Cat's loyalty

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.470
has been proven beyond doubt.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:04.870
What I'm trying to say is,

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:05.890
although I've seen

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.120
the correspondence
between Chief Zhuge and his son,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.410
I don't know the specific contents.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.950
[Secret Letter]

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.480
Because they wrote in code,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.770
which requires a codebook

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.180
to decipher.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.230
You mean

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.950
the people who rescued Huang Wuchang

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:18.810
cracked the Zhuge family's code?

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.080
How is that possible?

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.440
Of course, it's possible.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.150
Pigeon message intelligence holds value,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.630
so naturally, there are people out there

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.810
who specialize in
collecting and decoding it.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.630
It has even become

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.730
a business.

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.770
There's such a business?

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:32.770
Indeed, there is.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.190
In the martial world, there are people
who collect

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.490
intelligence from pigeon messagesâ€”

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:37.890
they're called Book Merchants.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:38.790
Then there are others

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.300
who decode the obtained intelligence

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.130
and transcribe it,

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.060
called Scribes.

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.980
Those who trade in intelligence are called
Book Collectors.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.340
Chief Fang is right.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.030
The people who rescued Huang Wuchang

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.870
must be connected to this group.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.280
I've investigated them before.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.590
They frequently appear around
Sibao Street.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.350
Perhaps you could go there

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:58.380
and try your luck.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.740
There is a copy of the correspondence

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.340
between Chief Zhuge and his son
in the dovecote.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.360
I'll have someone deliver it to you later.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.630
I hope it'll be helpful

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:07.060
for your investigation.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.850
Thank you, Director Blue Cat.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.140
Why are you all just standing there

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.310
doing nothing?

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.670
Hurry up and escort Director Blue Cat out.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:17.880
Please.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.130
For the sake of the people here,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.700
I implore you

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.510
to ensure that Huang Wuchang is

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.640
brought to justice.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.240
We will.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.400
Also,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.050
I don't believe that someone

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.740
who could say what you just said

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.730
could possibly be the cold-blooded killer

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.140
the legends speak of.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.160
Mr. Xiao, good luck.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.910
[Prison]

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.860
Chief.

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.570
For my son?

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.050
The young master isn't used to

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.120
the food from the prison kitchen,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.470
so he asked me to
buy something from outside.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.050
He's locked up

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.710
and still has so many demands.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.880
Chief,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.600
keeping him locked up like this
isn't a solution.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.330
After all, we've arrested Xiao Beiming.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.020
How about

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.080
we go plead with His Majesty

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.910
to have the Young Master released sooner?

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:37.240
Plead with His Majesty?

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.180
If we can't solve the Yesha case,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:41.450
you might need to prepare

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:42.900
prison meals for me too.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.330

What's this supposed to mean?

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.040
I can't even make sense of it.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.390
That's exactly the idea.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:00.690
Once we translate it using the codebook,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:01.690
it'll make sense.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:03.680
So we still have to find the codebook.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.880
We'll need to go to Zhuge Kongyun again.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:08.310
Zhuge Kongyun is locked up now.

No one can get in to see him.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.990
Actually, it's not that difficult.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.660
It's not like

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.900
we haven't sneaked in there before.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.339
We can just go in again and look around.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.380
You think the Secret Investigation Unit

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.319
is full of idiots?

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.089
After being fooled once,

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.650
they'll definitely be on guard.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.710
If we get caught, we'll be in trouble.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.069
There is someone who can help.

at a glance.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.520

Remember,

they're operating in secret,

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.750
so you must not wear official uniforms

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.540
and should dress as ordinary citizens.

when he was safely concealed.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.010
And that girl,

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.920
he's clearly the one
who killed her father,

the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.970
That's much easier than
begging that blockhead

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:43.970
for help.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:45.460
I've checked.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:46.610
Ever since last time,

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.020
they've been changing their passwords

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.130
and codes daily.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.210
Even with disguises, we can't get in.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.160
What should we do then?

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:54.920

Coming.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.630
We've walked up and down
this entire street,

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.260
but there's no "Book Merchant" anywhere.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.320
Since these people

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.170
dare to sell the intelligence
from the dovecote,

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.920
they're certainly not to be
underestimated.

Since we haven't found
any aecondhand book stalls,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.240
I think...

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.250
they must have disguised themselves

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.780
as other vendors.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.310

How much are your sugar figurines?

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.670
Pre-made ones are 5 copper coins each,

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.970

You're good.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.310
You could think of
asking a street vendor like him,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.850
who's been selling goods on this street
year-round

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.950
and knows every stall

to ask about those things.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.140
Their businesses

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:09.510
are just covers.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.800
I think besides selling information,

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.380
they probably sell

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:12.720
some indecent items to make money.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.630
After all, not many people

Judging by how you're acting,

this doesn't seem like your first time
buying forbidden books.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.830
I recall that in our Qi Kingdom,
trading forbidden books

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:20.860
is punishable by a fine.

How do you manage to intercept them?

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.800
They let the pigeons out

for exercise every day.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.550

near the dovecote

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.890
to lure the pigeons.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.270
But those pigeons are quite smart.

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:39.320
They don't easily eat food from outside.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.440
However, the bait we make

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.640
is very similar to

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.010
what they're fed at the dovecote.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:44.870
Eventually, we managed to

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.110
lure them to eat it.

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.790
This is the lightest one.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:48.880
Mine is pretty good too,

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.610
just a bit more severe than his.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:52.540
If these two aren't enough,

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.660
there's another one over there.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.240
Let's begin.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:58.960
Let's do it.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.500
Wait! Wait.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.720
I-I remember now.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.090
I have something to say!

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.830
Since you've remembered,

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:12.490
stand up and tell us properly.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.990
No need, no need.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:15.040
I'll say it on my knees.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.800
Stand up.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.540
Alright.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:18.620
Well...

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.740
not long ago, I heard

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.640
that a Book Merchant

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.390
intercepted the intelligence
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.920
He's a veteran in our trade,

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.270
but I've only heard about him.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.580
I've never met the man!

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.350
Where did he send the intelligence?

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:30.550
And who is the Scribe?

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.270
They say

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.870
he usually works as a Book Merchant

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.330
and also works as a Scribe.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.680
He even knows how to interpret codes.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.520
I figure

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.340
this person must be

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.240
personally in contact with

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.970
those Book Collectors higher up the chain.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:43.090
He rarely buys information from others

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:44.230
and mostly does the scribing.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.580
And the information he releases
is always related to

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:48.380
murder cases handled by the government.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.550
So there's been

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.050
a rumor circulating outside

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.010
that this person

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.420
works in the Ministry of Justice.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:58.490
Don't look at me like that, officers.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:59.730
I... I really

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.520
don't know anything else.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.320
I've told you everything I know.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:26.830
Any news from outside?

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.760
What are Zhong Xueman
and the others doing?

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.130
No new information

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:34.150
has come through.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.110
Young Master...

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.570
I've been wanting to ask you,

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.590
was it worth handing Xiao Beiming

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.330
over to the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.290
and putting yourself

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.500
in such a...

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.990
dire situation?

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.190
Of course it was.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.690
But the Elite Constabulary Unit
and our Secret Investigation Unit

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.860
are sworn enemies after all.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.450
Didn't you just

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.380
help the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.100
Those pointless conflicts

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:09.350
are far less important

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.110
than human lives and the truth.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.220
But Xiao Beiming is Yesha after all.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.140
That hasn't been confirmed yet.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.260
Haven't you been asking me

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.010
why, even though I discovered him

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.810
by Zhong Xueman's side long ago,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.010
I delayed arresting him?

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:24.980
That's right.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.220
His Majesty issued an edict long ago:

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.420
if we can't catch him,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.010
both you and the Chief will be beheaded.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.930
Why did you not only not arrest him

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.900
but also deliberately let him escape
several times?

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.810
Because in this world,

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.700
apart from Zhong Xueman,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.670
the person who least wants him to be Yesha

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:49.100
might be me.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:49.860
But...

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.820
but haven't you always

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.590
disliked Xiao Beiming, Young Master?

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.110
Yes.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.110
I detest him.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.310
I detest that he's smarter than me,

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.570
more decisive than me,

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:00.160
â™ª An elegant gentleman â™ª

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.370
and better at solving cases than me.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:02.490
â™ª Beauty, yet prejudice â™ª

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.240
If there's anyone in this world

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.050
who wants him dead the most,

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:04.980
â™ª With courage â™ª

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:05.330
it's probably me too.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.770
â™ª The gentleman understands â™ª

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:08.360
I don't understand.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.990
â™ª Traveling freely in this world â™ª

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.030
That's the contradiction of human nature.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.270
â™ª Only wielding his sword â™ª

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.930
The person you detest the most

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040
could also be

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:17.190
the one you admire the most.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.750
â™ª I cry alone â™ª

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:20.420
The one you most wish

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:20.730
â™ª Grieving over past grievances â™ª

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:22.120
to see disgraced...

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:23.960
â™ª Thinking about you again and again â™ª

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.820
could also be

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:26.740
the one whose name

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:26.880
â™ª It's just one glance â™ª

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.480
you most want to see cleared.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.260
The one you most want dead

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.810
â™ª And I can't sleep at night â™ª

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:32.740
could also be...

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:35.200
the one you most want

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:35.820
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.060
to keep alive.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:38.450
If he really is Yesha,

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.090
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:41.810
then wouldn't I,

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.310
who have been chasing after him
all this time,

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.280
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.350
be the biggest fool

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:46.430
in the world?

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:46.760
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.410
But there's also no evidence to prove

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.550
that he isn't Yesha.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.790
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:51.590
That's right.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.180
There is indeed no evidence to prove

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:53.910
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.040
that he isn't Yesha.

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.910
The Chief always tells me

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.060
that solving cases requires evidence

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.930
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.290
and catching criminals requires evidence.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:01.780
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:02.760
But sometimes,

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.660
so-called evidence

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.290
is just a lie that blinds us.

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:07.920
â™ª In this cold world â™ª

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.290
The moment he appeared
at the execution ground,

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.000
â™ª So pitiful, have you ever â™ª

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:11.080
â™ª Believed in forever? â™ª

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.810
I looked into his eyes,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.020
and I knew I was right.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.670
â™ª Looking at the stars
at the seaside at night â™ª

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:18.940
â™ª I'm lost â™ª

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:20.179
â™ª Love is beyond words â™ª

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.139
If

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:22.280
he were truly

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.810
that cold-blooded killer,

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.770
â™ª I cry alone â™ª

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.560
how could he risk his life

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:27.110
for personal feelings?

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.590
â™ª Grieving over past grievances â™ª

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:29.719
And how could he have

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.190
a group of friends willing

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.909
â™ª Thinking about you again and again â™ª

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:31.480
to stand up for him,

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.280
regardless of their own safety?

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.199
â™ª It's just one glance â™ª

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:36.840
So, he definitely isn't Yesha.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.699
â™ª And I can't sleep at night â™ª

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.800
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.590
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.320
I've probably been locked up for too long,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:49.870
and my mind isn't clear anymore.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.650
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.380
If the Chief hears me say this,

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:53.210
he'll punish me again.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.650
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.290
Li Long.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.260
Although you're my guard,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.250
you're also one of the few people

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.890
I can truly call a friend.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.570
Being able to say this to you today

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.680
makes me feel much better.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:10.020
Come on,

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:10.780
let's eat.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.640
Young Master.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:17.990
What you've told me,

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:19.420
I don't understand,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.730
nor do I want to.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.030
I don't trust

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.340
those people
from the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.920
and I trust Xiao Beiming even less.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:25.720
I understand.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.750
Then just pretend

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.260
I never said any of this today.

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:33.170
Let's eat.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.960
But I will

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.040
always trust you, Young Master.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:42.560
Always.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.150
What's this?

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.050
This is from the people
at the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.110
They wanted me to

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.680
pass a message to you,

00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.880
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.920
but I refused.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:57.930
So they hid the message in these pastries,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.320
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.520
but I found it anyway.

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.010
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.480
â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:10.600
Thanks.

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.210
â™ª The gentleman understands â™ª

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.730
[Codebook]

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.160
[Mandarin Duck Restaurant]

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.150
My young master received your message

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.950
and has sent me to respond to you.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:38.610
Thank you.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.090
The codebook is "Chronicle of
Pacifying Pirates in the Eastern Sea."

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.340
But that's clearly

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.620
an out-of-print book.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.760
I've looked everywhere

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.010
but couldn't find it.

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:49.330
Xueman,

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.610
you've read many folk stories.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.010
Does that ring any bells?

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.770
You don't even know "Chronicle of
Pacifying Pirates in the Eastern Sea"?

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.340
Wait.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:59.060
What do you want?

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.490
Don't get physical.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.880
You know that book?

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:03.860
Who doesn't know it?

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.870
It's about a general
from the previous dynasty

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.270
hunting down pirates.

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:08.820
How do you know about it?

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:14.910
There's a storyteller

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.480
at the Bao Yi Xing Teahouse.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.650
He often tells stories

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:19.090
from the book.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:19.890
I've heard

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.270
that the book has been
out of print for years,

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.500
so in the entire capital,

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.720
he's the only one
who knows the stories in it.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.550
Many of our men have gone to listen.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.390
If someone is really using the book

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.120
as some kind of code reference,

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.130
they'd definitely have to go to him.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.380
Earlier today,
that Book Merchant confessed

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.030
that there's a very suspicious Scribeâ€”

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.910
possibly someone
from the Ministry of Justice.

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:37.790
So,

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.290
there really is a traitor among us?

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.370
Then, Constable Fang,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.280
please help us and go check it out.

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:47.550
What?

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.620
Are you ordering me around now?

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:50.620
Is that a problem?

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.050
Fine.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.300
Same as usual.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.340
Eat while it's hot.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:02.940
I'm on it.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.570
Mr. Wang!

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.920
Constable Fang,

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.710
what brings you here?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.230
I have something
I'd like to ask you about.

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.840
Go ahead.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.050
Have you recently

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.890
let anyone else copy your rare edition of

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.150
Chronicle of
Pacifying Pirates in the Eastern Sea?

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.360
Especially someone like me, a constable?

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.630
Let me think.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.500
Hardly anyone even knows to come to me

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.730
for the book.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.510
I remember now.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.950
There really was such a person

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:35.010
who came to copy it.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.670
You should be quite familiar with him.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.120
It was Constable Jiang

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:39.570
from your Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.530
No one else besides him.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.410
Yi?
