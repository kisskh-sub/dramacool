[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.890
[Episode 11]

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.789
No.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.320
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.509
Feng Qingzhuo. Feng Qingzhuo.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.039
It's okay now.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.590
It wasn't me.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.320
Feng Qingzhuo! Feng Qingzhuo!

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.120
It's okay now.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.700
How did I end up here?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.729
Tell me first,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.160
what happened back then?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.360
Back then,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.510
on my way back to Dingfeng Pavilion,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.310
I noticed a medicine bottle was missing,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.039
so I hurried back to
the Huo Mansion to look for it.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.460
Suddenly I saw Mrs. Huo

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.210
hurrying toward the backyard.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.470
Mrs. Huo was alone,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.560
looking anxious.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.120
And the backyard is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.560
where the Huo family disciples live.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.160
I thought it was suspicious,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.750
so I followed her.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.310
When I woke up,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.660
Xue Qianshan's body

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.140
was lying right next to me.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.360
I... I don't know

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.360
what happened.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.590
It's Mrs. Huo again.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.970
I really didn't kill him.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.030
I swear I didn't kill him.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.870
I'm not a murderer.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.910
Beiming, what should I do?

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.750
Don't panic.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.770
This case

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.840
isn't that complicated.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.680
Zhuge Kongyun said the same thing.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680
Did he discover something

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.750
that I missed?

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.000
Xueman,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.250
when you arrived at

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.190
Feng Qingzhuo's place,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.010
when did the people

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.030
from the Huo family arrive?

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.750
Stop him.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.710
It was only a short while

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.530
before Mrs. Huo arrived
with a group of disciples

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.660
from the Huo family.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.600
That's exactly the problem.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:19.920
What do you mean?

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.320
I... I don't understand.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.600
Look.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.120
This is where the disciples live.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.470
This is where Xue Qianshan lives.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.630
Both are in the backyard.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.840
It is not surprising

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.310
that the disciples rushed to the scene

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.870
as soon as they heard the shouting.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.079
But Mrs. Huo lives in the south courtyard.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.190
From the south courtyard to the backyard,

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.850
even if the servants went to report

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.690
immediately,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.570
it would take some time

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.060
to go back and forth.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.170
Mrs. Huo immediately arrived
with a group of disciples

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.400
from the Huo family,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.000
which is the inconsistency.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520
And Coroner Feng also mentioned

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.360
that he saw

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.360
Mrs. Huo entering the backyard at dusk.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.470
This means

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.840
Mrs. Huo was in the backyard

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.400
from dusk until late night.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.310
So... what?

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.820
What does that prove?

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.400
Mrs. Huo

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.280
secretly

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.240
sneaked into

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.420
the backyard alone

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.030
and stayed until late night.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.830
What do you think that suggests?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.430
Are you suggesting

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680
she was having an affair
with one of the disciples?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.950
If this is true,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.300
then the man she was having an affair with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.160
is Li Xiao.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.160
Why would it be Li Xiao?

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.860
I think Huo Dairong must have

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.120
discovered this affair.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.680
That night
when we sneaked into the Huo Mansion,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.110
she deliberately led me to the bedroom,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.490
probably wanting me to catch

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.950
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao in the act.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.000
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.120
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.270
Li Xiao had already left,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.870
leaving only Mrs. Huo behind.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:39.940
Not only that,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.480
Huo Dairong once told me

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.240
Mrs. Huo wasn't happy after her marriage,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.390
until Li Xiao
joined the household 3 years ago,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.310
and only then did her mood improve.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.740
When did you

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.920
join General Huo's service?

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.600
Have you ever
gone to battle with General Huo?

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.510
I joined the household 3 years ago,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.040
too late to have seen
any battlefield action.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.159
That could just be a coincidence.

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:59.420
There's something even more important.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.880
I think I've seen

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.030
this mark somewhere before.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.050
This is the unique mark

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.000
of the Kunwu Knife Factory.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.560
Kunwu Knife Factory?

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.950
Do you still remember what I told you

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.700
about Mrs. Huo's father,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.160
who runs a weapon workshop?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.810
Xueman and I saw a small knife

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.920
at Li Xiao's bedside,

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.510
-and there's this mark on the knife.
-Itâ€™s a gift from my family.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.510
I keep it by my bedside

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.440
to think of my family day and night.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.190
Family?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.510
Or lover?

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.200
So I guess this knife

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.730
was a gift from Mrs. Huo.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.600
Moreover,

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.480
they must have been lovers before.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.500
Could it be that General Huo

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.890
was killed by them?

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.310
A murder for love?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.720
Without catching them in the act,

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.110
even with this kind of evidence,

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.190
we can't prove anything.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.070
Then what does this have to do

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.600
with Xue Qianshan's death?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.870
Xueman,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.810
do you remember the conversation

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.630
between Xue Qianshan and Li Xiao

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.190
at the entrance of the gambling den?

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.570
The property of the entire Huo family

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.690
is in your hands,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.320
far more than just 500 taels.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.420
Those despicable things you've done

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.510
will not only ruin your reputation,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.300
but you can forget about taking

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.000
even a single tael from the Huo family.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.040
Perhaps even Master

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.360
was killed by you two.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.560
-Masterâ€™s death has nothing to do with us.
-Xue was referring to the two of them,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.430
not just one.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.660
He also mentioned
the despicable things they've done.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.360
So I suspect Xue Qianshan had

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.920
evidence of the affair between Li Xiao

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.160
and Mrs. Huo.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.720
Huo Dairong also mentioned

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.000
Xue Qianshan told her

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.140
he had something valuable

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.720
that could bring him continuous income.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.800
That matches up.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.120
I understand now.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.090
So,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.720
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao
were having an affair,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.430
and then

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.480
Xue Qianshan got hold of evidence,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.200
and he used this evidence

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.390
to blackmail Li Xiao.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.280
Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo
couldn't take it anymore,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.450
so they killed Xue Qianshan

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.580
and framed me for it.

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:55.800
Everything makes sense now.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.170
Then the evidence Xue Qianshan had

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.120
is what we need!

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.720
The evidence
must still be at the Huo Mansion.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.360
I'll go there right now.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.190
It's too late.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.460
If it was

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.430
really that important,

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.240
once Xue Qianshan died,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.220
Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.020
would definitely have taken it.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.120
But without the evidence,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.040
without proof,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.260
Coroner Feng cannot

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.240
prove his innocence.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.970
Don't worry.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.410
I've asked Tong Shuang
to watch the Huo Mansion.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.140
If anything happens,

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.800
he'll notify us immediately.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.810
Zhuge Kongyun

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.070
also seemed to know everything.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.680
Could he have reached
the same conclusion as you?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.800
With his intelligence,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.190
it's not surprising that he could

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.320
figure all this out.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.360
Beiming,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.630
Constable Zhong,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.510
this time

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.880
I owe you both so much.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.930
Otherwise, I...

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.800
Go get changed.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.720
Don't catch a cold.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.360
Alright.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.770
Next time if I pass out again,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.530
just use a needle on my Baihui acupoint

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.990
and that will do the trick.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.800
No need to splash me with water again.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.600
Go now.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.310
-Donâ€™t... splash water.
-Go now.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.070
Will everything be alright?

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.760
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.740
I never thought

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.140
it would come to this.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.690
The property of the whole family

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.310
has really fallen into

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.120
the hands of Huo Dairong and her mother.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.980
Those constables

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.480
will investigate us sooner or later.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.970
Before they figure it out,

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.630
we should leave as soon as possible.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.190
The property is just material possession.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.210
As long as we're safe and together,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.610
that's all that matters.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.960
Zhuge Kongyun suspects you?

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:35.360
It's my fault
for not being careful enough,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.750
making him suspicious.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.510
I managed to cover it up last night,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.309
but with his suspicious nature,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.750
he'll definitely
keep a close eye on me from now on.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.250
I'm afraid if I can't hide it well enough,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.550
something might go wrong.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.530
You're not really someone

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.360
who knows how to lie and cover things up.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.420
With his keen eyes,

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.580
no matter how well you try to hide it,

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.180
you won't escape his notice.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.640
What should I do then?

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.720
Then don't hide anything.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.550
Be yourself.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.850
Didn't he say

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.340
you're like your old self?

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.000
Then just

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.090
be your old self.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.390
As long as you're confident,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:05.840
do whatever you want.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.550
He can't do anything to you.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.270
My old self?

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.440
So you're saying

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.910
if he suspects me again,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.400
I should just beat him up?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.560
That's not a bad idea.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.030
I've been wanting to beat him up.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.480
I'm actually looking forward to it now.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.320
Hit him hard.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.690
I've been
putting up with him for too long.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.960
Beiming.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.510
What is it?

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.760
Something's happening at the Huo Mansion.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.750
[Huo Mansion]

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.970
Mrs. Huo left early this morning

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.000
for Biyun Temple,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.240
saying she wanted to pray for blessings.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.630
I guess she'll be back tonight.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.550
She'll be back tonight?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.120
Yes.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.360
Okay.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.190
Young Master,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.010
perhaps we should wait for her to return.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240
Going to Biyun Temple

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.480
is just a day trip,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.630
no need to bring much luggage.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.790
The wheel tracks
would be relatively shallow.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.480
Look at these two wheel tracks.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.370
They're deep.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.920
Clearly the carriage

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.120
was loaded with valuables and luggage.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.370
It doesn't look like

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.870
she's coming back.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.480
Then...

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.740
She... she's escaped?

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.030
Take more men
and go after her immediately.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.670
Yes.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.670
Sir,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.400
help me with the luggage.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.600
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.750
We need to get going.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.480
You two seem in quite a hurry.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.840
Where are you going?

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.260
Be sensible.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.170
Don't make us use force.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.730
We won't go with you.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.750
We'll fight if we have to.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.440
Xiao!

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.480
Don't!

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.440
Beiming, what should we do next?

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.790
Take them to
the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.200
The Secret Investigation Unit?

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.060
What about you?

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.200
I need to go back to the Huo Mansion.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.030
Alright.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.390
[Huo Mansion]

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.440
No wonder you're the top constable
in the Qi Kingdom.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.360
You've caught the murderers so quickly.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.390
Miss Huo, I have a favor to ask.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.000
What can I do for you, Mr. Xiao?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.200
I'm at your service.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.270
Could you take me to

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.000
General Huo's study for a look?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.080
My father's study?

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.980
What do you want to see?

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.000
There are still some clues
I haven't figured out.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.860
I'd like to investigate further.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.270
We're still searching,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.050
yet you've brought them back.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.320
This means before I discovered

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.850
their escape this morning,

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.460
you already had your suspicions.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.520
Why didn't you say anything about it?

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.610
Or perhaps someone behind you

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.140
has been giving you answers,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.130
and you were lying in wait for them?

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200
Constable Zhong,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.000
don't you want to

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.360
explain yourself to me?

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.000
What are you doing?

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.670
Do I need to explain myself to you?

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.960
What exactly do I need to explain?

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.790
You've repeatedly

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:08.000
questioned me in roundabout ways.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.440
Am I a prisoner of your
Secret Investigation Unit?

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.960
If it weren't for our cooperation,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.820
and my consideration
for the bigger picture,

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.870
I wouldn't have tolerated this
again and again.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.120
You take my patience for granted

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.390
and keep picking fights with me.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.570
You already discovered the truth

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.960
about Coroner Feng's case.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.550
Did you ever explain that to me?

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.800
If I hadn't figured it out myself

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.910
and gone to stake out the Huo Mansion,

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:22.600
I wouldn't have noticed them

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.790
sneaking out

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:24.680
and followed them all the way.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.480
I went through all that trouble
to catch them for you,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.510
and now you're taking

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.000
the tone of an interrogator with me.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.120
Who do you think you are?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.720
I...

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.480
Calm down.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.910
Calm down.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.870
If you don't want to cooperate,

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.930
I'll take them back

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.280
to the Elite Constabulary Unit right now.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.720
But if you dare provoke me again,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.160
I swear I'll beat you up just like before

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.240
so badly that you won't be able
to get out of bed.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.080
It's my fault.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.120
I apologize to you.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.960
Let's talk things through properly
from now on.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.290
Don't get angry.
It's bad for your health.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.720
She has such a short fuse.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.340
She hasn't changed a bit.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.230
Have you found anything?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.790
Miss Huo, what is this?

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.910
I've never

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.360
entered this study before,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.570
so I don't really know

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.000
what my father was doing.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.480
As you can see,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.450
the Secret Investigation Unit

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.390
has many ways to deal with suspects.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.060
If you don't want to suffer,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.750
just answer whatever is asked.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.520
Don't worry, both of you.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.200
We won't force a confession.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.870
As long as you tell the truth,

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.070
we won't make things difficult for you.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.860
What do you want to ask?

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.030
You killed

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.790
Xue Qianshan, right?

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.760
Xue Qianshan discovered

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.630
your affair,

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.030
and blackmailed you for money,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.750
so you decided to kill him.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.540
Coincidentally, Coroner Feng

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.550
showed up unexpectedly last night,

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.600
and you took the opportunity

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.730
to kill Xue Qianshan

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.390
and frame Coroner Feng.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.130
Am I right?

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.550
I confess.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.320
I did kill Xue Qianshan.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.030
Xiao!

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.720
He blackmailed me and Ying.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.780
He deserved to die.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.240
I know what you're trying to do,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:50.970
but the crime

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.840
isn't something
you can just take the blame for.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.510
Because you didn't kill him,

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.200
Mrs. Huo did.

00:16:57.510 --> 00:16:58.970
You're talking nonsense!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.270
Last night when I examined

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.599
the wound, I discovered

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:07.240
that the fatal stab wound

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.400
on Xue Qianshan's body

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.829
was delivered from below upward.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.630
Judging from the angle of entry,

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.200
the killer's height must be

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.730
at least 10 inches
shorter than Xue Qianshan,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.680
and Mrs. Huo's height

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.819
is exactly 10 inches
shorter than Xue Qianshan.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.550
Although your martial skills

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.200
aren't as good as Xue Qianshan's,

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.349
he would have been on guard against you,

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.630
making it nearly impossible for you

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.200
to kill him face-to-face.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.990
But someone who appears

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:32.310
as fragile as Mrs. Huo

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.640
could lower his guard,

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.550
and killed him with one strike.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.310
I told you.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.160
I killed him.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.880
Xiao!

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.030
Yes,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.920
I killed him.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.660
If Xue Qianshan disappeared,

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:55.960
no one would know about

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.690
the secret between Xiao and me.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.200
The Huo family's property

00:17:59.200 --> 00:17:59.880
would naturally

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.200
fall into my hands.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.240
I thought

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.420
that if I did it myself, it wouldn't

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.750
raise suspicion easily,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.080
but I never expected...

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:07.200
Ying.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.920
General Huo's death

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.200
is also connected to you, isn't it?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.440
No, I didn't kill General Huo.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.250
General Huo's death

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:24.680
has nothing to do with us.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.720
Xue Qianshan was merely asking for money

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.780
when he was killed.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.880
If General Huo

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.350
had discovered your affair,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.350
you probably
wouldn't have survived, right?

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.310
How could General Huo's death

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.750
have nothing to do with you?

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.580
General Huo's death

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.720
truly has nothing to do with us.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.550
Hallucinogenic drugs were found

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.810
in General Huo's body.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.000
The pharmacy has always been

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.400
under Mrs. Huo's supervision,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.640
and if poison is found

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.720
in those tonics,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.650
it would be irrefutable evidence.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.810
I have evidence

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.540
that can prove our innocence.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640
This is strange.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.590
What's this

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.790
on the pill?

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.680
Well,

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.400
what have you found?

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.670
It seems to be some kind of medicine

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.920
that was ground up

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.050
and mixed into General Huo's

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.480
daily tonics.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.060
But this pill...

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.440
There's something wrong with it?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.720
The powder on it

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.440
contains mainly red crystal.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.070
The red crystal is extremely rare.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.350
I've only seen it mentioned

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:01.830
in my master's ancient books.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.000
A trace of it can cause hallucinations.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.160
So this confirms

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.940
that General Huo died from

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.680
consuming hallucinogenic drugs.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.400
But the red crystal is incredibly rare.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.160
It must be extracted from

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.960
rare minerals.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.770
The extraction process is very complex.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.960
Those who can extract the red crystal

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.560
must be experts in pharmacy.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.120
There's no one like that
in the Huo family.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.730
What kind of evidence is this?

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.480
My hands

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.310
were crippled by General Huo.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.600
In other words,

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.880
he had long known about

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.480
my relationship with Ying.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.410
What did you say?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.510
Back then,

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.690
my father and brother

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.270
forced me to marry General Huo

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.960
to save the knife factory.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.270
But before marrying him,

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:48.880
Xiao and I had already

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.740
pledged ourselves to each other.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.750
After marrying General Huo,

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.490
I lived in constant fear.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.130
Until 3 years ago,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.500
Xiao was willing to sell himself

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.120
to become
General Huo's disciple just for me.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.680
But General Huo was shrewd and ruthless.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.280
We couldn't hide it from him.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.030
Six months ago,

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.270
General Huo

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.290
discovered our relationship.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:27.090
In a fit of rage,

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:27.790
[Senior and virtuous]

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.350
he beat me up badly.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.700
My wounds haven't healed to this day.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.550
And Xiao,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.980
in order to appease General Huo's anger,

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.110
went so far as to sacrifice his hands,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.960
plunging them into a pot of boiling oil

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.070
as penance.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.800
If General Huo found out about

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.930
your relationship,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.200
would he still keep you
at the Huo Mansion?

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.070
To be honest,

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.050
I've never understood

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.030
this matter either.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.870
Later on,

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.420
he just stayed in his study,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.720
ignoring both me and Xiao,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.440
acting as if

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.750
nothing had happened.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.210
The more he acted this way,

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.740
the more anxious we became.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.070
With his influence,

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.880
we didn't dare run anywhere.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.510
We suffered like this

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:10.480
until the day before he died.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.440
He did something

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.480
that Xiao and I

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.110
still can't understand.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.200
Master.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.890
[Divorce Agreement]

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.130
Divorce agreement?

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.750
The evidence Xue Qianshan obtained

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:50.880
was precisely this divorce agreement.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.750
Recently,

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.590
I discovered I was pregnant.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.030
General Huo had got
some unmentionable disease,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:55.880
so he certainly knew

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.110
the child wasn't his.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.840
Unmentionable disease?

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.790
General Huo was infertile.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.070
He was seriously wounded

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.920
on the battlefield in his early years.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.590
He had been taking medicine all along

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.030
but he never got better.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.110
Once Ying's pregnancy became visible,

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:11.510
we would certainly die.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.960
Death seemed inevitable either way,

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.400
so I confessed to General Huo

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.730
about the whole affair.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.980
But to my surprise,

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:20.940
he gave me this divorce agreement.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.110
It stated that

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.720
[Divorce Agreement]

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.120
although he despised me,

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.280
for the sake of the child

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:25.590
[Draftsman of the Divorce Agreement:
Husband Huo Zongyao]

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.830
in my womb,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.400
he would spare Xiao and me

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.480
and let us live.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.510
General Huo treated us so well.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.170
We couldn't be more grateful.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.000
How could we possibly kill him?

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.750
You claim this divorce agreement

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.500
was given to you

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.270
the day before General Huo died,

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.750
but you didn't leave.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.400
Was it because his death

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.400
gave you some wicked ideas?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:49.590
Yes.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.930
General Huo died suddenly.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.310
We discovered that no one knew

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.970
about the divorce agreement.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.110
If Ying continued as Mrs. Huo,

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.510
we could rightfully

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.000
inherit all the property.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.500
But unexpectedly,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.270
Xue Qianshan stole the divorce agreement

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.590
to blackmail us.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.820
But we never intended to kill him.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.490
We just wanted to talk to him

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.960
and see if we could use some money

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.890
to buy back the divorce agreement.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.720
But

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.880
we never expected...

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:19.370
I have something valuable.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.350
Making money with it
is the most reliable way.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.590
What could be so valuable?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.070
It isn't valuable itself,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.960
but it can bring me

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.160
a lot of money.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.170
Really?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.370
You don't believe me?

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.510
Fine.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.070
I'll bring it

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.270
to show you right now.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.200
Wait for me, Dairong.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.640
If Huo Dairong saw

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.110
this divorce agreement

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.400
and knew

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.370
that she was the only heir

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:50.480
to the Huo family,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.640
then we would be done for.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.790
So

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.510
we had no choice but to kill him

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.400
and used that unconscious coroner

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.340
as a scapegoat.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.240
Ying,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.240
how could you be so careless?

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.440
What should we do now?

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.270
The top priority now
is the matter at hand.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.600
Carry him inside first.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:16.160
General Huo
had been poisoned for a long time.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.680
As someone close to him,

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.550
and as the person

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.030
in charge of General Huo's pharmacy,

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.880
have you noticed

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.940
anything unusual?

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.350
Speaking of unusual things,

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:26.720
there were some.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.880
But I only noticed them

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.020
after his death.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.100
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.250
Why does this pill

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.400
have such a fishy stench?

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.030
Of course.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.260
The red crystal naturally

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.680
has this distinctive fishy odor.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.030
If it's not properly processed,

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.630
it's quite easy to identify.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.200
That's not right.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.750
What is it?

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.160
If that's the case,

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.300
then Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.830
might not be the murderers.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.160
What?

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.330
Didn't you say that

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.600
General Huo had been taking this medicine

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.550
for at least half a year?

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:06.550
This medicine is so foul-smelling.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.540
How could General Huo not have noticed

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.030
after taking it for so long?

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.980
What do you mean?

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.570
Are you suggesting

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.120
someone used these pills

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.890
deliberately to misdirect us?

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.660
Exactly.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.880
But this person was too obvious

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.310
and ended up revealing flaws in his plan.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.140
If Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.280
were not the murderers,

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.410
then who would it be?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.050
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.080
Please find Tong Shuang for me.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.470
I have something for him to do.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:33.160
Okay.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.790
General Huo came from
a military background.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.480
He used to have a bad temper

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.110
and was rather harsh
with the household staff,

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.070
resorting to physical violence sometimes,

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.780
but he was also fair and impartial,

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.240
keeping strictly the rules
for reward and punishment.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240
But over the past six months,

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:58.900
his temper

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.480
had become increasingly erratic,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.880
and he frequently
resorted to physical violence.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.000
His disciples

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.230
suffered terribly.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.750
A few days ago, I passed by his study

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.240
and heard strange noises.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.640
And I actually saw...

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.310
Master.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.640
Master.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.640
Eating raw meat

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400
like a wild beast?

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.000
That should be a symptom

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.640
of the hallucinogenic drugs
that General Huo took.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.440
The next day when I saw him again,

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.400
he had absolutely no memory

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.330
of what happened the night before.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.930
I didn't dare to make a fuss,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.590
so I kept it

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:58.750
to myself.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.110
Soon after,

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.920
he handed me the divorce agreement.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.180
I've told you everything.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.590
It was our greed

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.920
that caused this terrible mistake.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.640
I'm willing to confess
and accept punishment

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.440
but I have one request

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:22.720
that I hope you both can grant.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.750
Speak.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.350
A life for a life.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.830
I killed Xue Qianshan

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.590
and I'll pay with my life.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.110
But before that,

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.310
would you allow me

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.840
to give birth to this child?

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.810
This child is innocent.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:41.550
Ying.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:52.440
I promise you.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.110
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.750
pregnant women who commit capital crimes

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:57.550
must wait until the child is born

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.350
before execution.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.090
I'll ensure your child is born safely

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.270
before the case is solved.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.390
Thank you, Constable Zhong.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.730
Thank you, Lord Zhuge.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.680
Thank you.

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:13.960
Thank you.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.590
Li Long.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.880
Prepare two clean cells.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.750
Also,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.640
do not torture Mrs. Huo.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.200
Without my permission,

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.960
no one is allowed to interrogate her.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.590
Yes.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.350
That's how it is.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:41.960
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:43.880
are not the murderers of General Huo.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.900
If they're not the murderers,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.030
who could it be?

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:48.110
Tong Shuang.

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.630
I found out

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.550
that for the past six months, General Huo

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.200
had been sleeping alone
in his study at night.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.240
This matches the interrogation result.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.590
General Huo moved to the study

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.440
because he discovered

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.240
the affair between his wife and Li Xiao.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.480
For six months, General Huo

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.280
had Madam Feng keep him company.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.440
When his newly wedded wife had an affair,

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.310
he remembered
the virtues of his concubine,

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:10.770
which is understandable.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.270
Madam Feng said herself

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.650
that she and General Huo were very close.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.790
Yes, very close indeed.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.960
The butler also mentioned

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.210
that General Huo loved tea.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.390
For General Huo's sake, Madam Feng

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.510
specifically visited a famous doctor

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.880
to learn how to make medicinal tea,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.030
which she brewed for him every day.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.480
General Huo loved it so much.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.750
The butler also said

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.510
that General Huo's face

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.720
never showed any smile before.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.720
But whenever he drank the tea,

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.250
he would grin with delight.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.400
Madam Feng?

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.930
Madam Feng had no motive

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.240
for the murder.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.070
The crux of the matter
does not lie with Madam Feng

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.270
but with Huo Dairong.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.030
Miss Huo?

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.640
What's wrong with her?

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.370
The reason we suspect

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:46.500
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:47.880
isn't without foundation.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.310
Since our night visit to the Huo Mansion,

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.550
Huo Dairong has been deliberately

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.720
steering our investigation

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.920
toward those two.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.590
If it weren't for that divorce agreement,

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.240
based solely on the toxic powder
on the medicine

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.590
and their affair,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.390
without any other

00:30:58.390 --> 00:30:59.320
solid evidence,

00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.830
it would have been possible to determine

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.490
that they were the murderers.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.640
What's wrong, Xueman?

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.510
Huo Dairong discovered your identity

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.770
but didn't expose you.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.240
Could she be using you

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.720
to help her expose the affair

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.320
between Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao?

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.240
No.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.160
No.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.880
Aren't you overthinking this?

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.470
From Miss Huo's perspective,

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:19.550
everything makes perfect sense.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.290
She discovered the affair

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:21.590
between Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.840
Her father was killed

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.250
and she wanted to bring them to justice.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.350
Is there a problem?

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.530
Besides, she had no motive

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:27.550
for the murder.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:29.800
Regardless of her motives,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.720
now that Mrs. Huo has been sentenced,

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.880
the ones who benefit the most

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.550
are Huo Dairong and her mother.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.480
That's a fact.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.360
Speaking of motives,

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:41.810
I have a new discovery.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.710
[It's too late to regret
the chaos at Haiya.]

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.000
[It's too late to regret
the chaos at Haiya.]

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.310
It's too late to regret
the chaos at Haiya.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.050
Where did you find this?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:02.920
In General Huo's study.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.880
Well, in that case,

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.880
General Huo was indeed

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.200
involved in the Haiya case.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.500
Didn't Mrs. Huo mention

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.920
that General Huo was infertile?

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.720
That's right.

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.240
She said he had been seriously wounded

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.350
on the battlefield in his early years.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.310
Madam Feng said

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:14.420
General Huo took her as his concubine

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:15.110
after returning from the battlefield,

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:16.440
which was 23 years ago.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.480
What if General Huo was already infertile

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.030
before he went to the battlefield?

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:21.020
Are you saying

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:22.550
Huo Dairong might not be

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.590
General Huo's biological daughter?

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.510
Miss Huo isn't his biological daughter?

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.720
How is that possible?

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.590
How could she possibly

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.960
keep that from General Huo?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.270
With General Huo's temperament,

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:31.790
how could he possibly

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.750
allow them to live

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.200
in his mansion for so long?

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:34.740
What if he had

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.000
a reason he couldn't send them away?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.880
What reason?

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.710
What year was it 23 years ago?

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.400
The 36th year of Ningtai.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.920
The fact that they mentioned
this year during their argument

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.040
must be significant.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.180
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Zhong Yunchi's Dossier]

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:44.550
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Zhong Yunchi]

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.270
King Zhong of Constables,
in the 36th year of Ningtai...

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:46.760
The 36th year of Ningtai...

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.550
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Miao Jie]

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:47.680
The 36th year of Ningtai.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:48.380
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Huo Zongyao]

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.270
The 36th year of Ningtai?

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.510
Haiya?

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.640
If Huo Dairong

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.240
really had something to do with Haiya,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.830
then General Huo might indeed

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.430
have concealed this matter.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.400
Wait.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.550
So this means Huo Dairong could be...

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.680
An orphan from Haiya.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.400
Every single survivor

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.480
of Haiya is Yesha.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.030
As long as there's one survivor

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.400
still breathing,

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.000
Yesha

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.550
will keep coming back.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.860
Then the motive for the murder

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.920
makes perfect sense now.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.110
So this case is not

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.040
completely unrelated to Yesha.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.510
But we don't have any

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.550
substantial evidence.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.480
What if General Huo

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.750
had Huo Dairong first

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:24.400
before going to the battlefield

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.310
and getting seriously wounded?

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.350
Then all our previous deductions

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.270
would be wrong.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:27.960
Yes.

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.590
So everything we have now

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.720
is just speculation.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.030
But whether we're investigating Haiya

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.440
or General Huo's death,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.270
we can't avoid

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.440
Huo Dairong and her mother.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.630
Miss Huo doesn't seem like

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.920
a bad person at all.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.750
You can't judge a book by its cover.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.920
You're so naive

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.310
that you're easily fooled by women.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.110
We need to go to the Huo Mansion now.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.310
Everyone, get ready.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.240
What's the reason

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.270
for us to go this time?

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.400
Medical treatment.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.230
Madam Feng
has a deficiency in vital energy,

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.000
which fails to nourish
her tendons and vessels,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.530
resulting in blood stasis.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:19.170
If she doesn't rest properly,

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.460
I'm afraid...

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.920
I know my own body

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.320
very well.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:30.880
Coroner Feng,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.630
just put it plainly.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.560
I'm afraid you might become paralyzed.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.300
Mr. Feng, please save my mother.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.960
As long as you can save my mother,

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.320
I'm willing to do anything.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.760
Dairong.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.590
Miss Huo, please get up.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:52.230
Miss Huo, as a doctor,

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.000
I will do my best.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.590
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.150
Miss Huo.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.000
I need a quiet place

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.110
to prepare medicine for Madam Feng.

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:05.710
Okay.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.600
Mr. Feng, please follow me.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:12.710
Goodbye.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.320
Thank you.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.400
You're welcome, Madam.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.230
I'm your junior

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.090
and I'm also Miss Huo's friend.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.150
Dairong is truly

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.590
fortunate to have

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.800
friends like you.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.260
Constable Zhong,

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.230
do you have something

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.190
to ask me?

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:50.180
I came today

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.070
because I do have

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.690
some questions for you.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:56.000
Go ahead.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:58.280
Then I'll be straightforward.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.620
Miss Huo is not

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:01.590
your biological daughter

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:02.760
with General Huo, is she?
