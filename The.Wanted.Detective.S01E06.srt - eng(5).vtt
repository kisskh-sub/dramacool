[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.880
[Episode 6]

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.590
It seems the frost toxin is acting up.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.560
What is frost toxin?

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.890
Boss has been poisoned?

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.840
I'm asking you a question.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.150
Did you do this to Boss?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.280
It was me.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.310
I'm the one who poisoned him.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.690
It has nothing to do with Coroner Feng.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.520
Constable Tong.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.590
Even if you suspect him,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.120
who are you to poison him?

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.150
What kind of constable are you?

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.950
You're practically a murderer.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.800
Tong Shuang.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.710
Boss.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.400
Boss.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.970
How are you feeling?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.190
Have you found the person?

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.430
You're not in good condition.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.490
Let Coroner Feng take you back first.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.430
Tell me what you found at the scene.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.680
Based on the scene,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.520
the killer is likely connected
to the salt and iron factory.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.920
Chief Fang has already taken people there.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.150
Constable Zhong,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.880
take Tong Shuang
to the salt and iron factory.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.680
Coroner Feng,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.960
take me to the scene.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.710
Boss.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800
Your condition now...

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.560
Go now.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.710
Let's go.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.310
Careful. Careful.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.310
[Gentle Breeze Arrives]

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.240
Where did the killer

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.440
take the victim from?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.910
At the time, a few maids

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.040
were with Young Master Ajia,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.840
[Gentle Breeze Arrives]

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.240
drinking and having fun here.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.910
The maids were drugged unconscious,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.510
so they didn't see anything.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.070
Everyone else was outside the courtyard

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.530
and couldn't hear a thing.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.870
Constable Zhu

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.410
found a torn piece of cloth

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.740
on that patch of thorns.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.960
He suspects

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.750
it was ripped

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.590
from the killer's pants.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.400
The cloth tasted of salt and iron.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.150
In the capital,

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.710
the only place that has both salt and iron

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:10.870
is the salt and iron factory.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.840
He suspects the killer is connected

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.440
to the salt and iron factory.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.910
Is there a problem?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.180
So the victim was taken over the wall.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.710
Coroner Feng,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.470
could you please

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.000
carry me to the wall?

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.360
Go over there.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.890
Alright.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.760
Nothing here.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.590
How's it going?

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.470
Nothing here either.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.329
Let's go ahead.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.470
I understand now.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.030
Understand what?

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.030
Beiming?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.000
Beiming!

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.680
Did you find him?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.120
There are too many warehouses here.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.030
It's like a maze.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.870
Keep looking.
There's no way we can't find him!

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.430
Yes.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.520
Let's go.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:42.430
Nobody.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.210
I'll check over there.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.560
This room hasn't been searched.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.240
Let's go.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.120
Why are you here?

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.080
Shouldn't you be outside

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.120
with Zhu Yitie?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.520
Why do you care where I am?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.650
We didn't find him outside,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.920
so I came in to check.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.080
What are you looking at?

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.720
Young Master Ajia! Young Master Ajia!

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.780
Young Master Ajia.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.690
Young Master Ajia. Young Master Ajia!

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.750
-Young Master Ajia.
-Young Master.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.120
Is he still breathing?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.040
I just checked.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.000
He's still breathing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.060
Then why are you just standing there?

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.680
Hurry and take him
to Marquis Jingshan's Mansion!

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.310
Yes.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.560
Young Master.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.870
Young Master!

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.600
Can you save him?

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.390
The thick threads on him

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.510
are too complex.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.920
I can't make sense of them.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.750
If we cut them by force,

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.560
he might lose too much blood.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.500
I don't dare take that risk.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.270
All I can do is use medicine
to stop the bleeding for now.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.720
But if we don't cut these threads,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.520
isn't my son just waiting to die?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.750
My Lord, forgive my limited skills.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.480
There's nothing else I can do.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.510
Useless fool!

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.200
Get lost!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.600
Go find a few more physicians!

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.630
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.680
At this point,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.800
you need to tell me the truth.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.270
What exactly have you found?

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.430
What is the relationship

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.630
between Xiao Beiming and Hibiscus?

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.000
Why did Xiao Beiming

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.430
commit such a brutal murder

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.430
for a young woman?

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.120
I don't know yet,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.600
but once we find the culprit,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
everything will be clear.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.560
The suspect has fled.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.240
Where are you gonna find more clues?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.040
Uncle.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.070
Uncle.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.000
Uncle, something's happened.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.130
Why are you yelling?

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.310
Well,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.430
C-Chief Zhuge is here.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.120
Chief Zhuge,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.520
what brings you

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.340
to the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.920
Yesha, Xiao Beiming, has appeared?

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.120
Has he?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.630
How come I know nothing about this?

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.680
Recently, the capital

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.360
has seen multiple corpse-sewing cases,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.510
with methods identical

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.510
to the Fengbo Lake case
from 3 years ago.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.130
I wonder if it's Chief Fang

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.480
keeping it under wraps,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.390
or if your whole unit

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.070
is trying to cover it up.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.600
The Yesha case was assigned

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.870
to the Secret Investigation Unit
to begin with.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.560
This case is of great importance.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.270
As long as Xiao Beiming remains at large,

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.190
His Majesty cannot rest easy.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.920
Chief Fang, if you're
withholding information

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.650
or deliberately interfering,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.380
then we'll have no choice

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:34.909
but to take this matter

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:35.240
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.600
before His Majesty.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.200
When that happens,

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.030
don't blame me for not holding back!

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:42.510
What did you say?

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:43.600
Say it again!

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.320
Stop!

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:45.320
Stop!

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.220
Everyone, stand down!

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.940
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:55.850
Chief Zhuge,

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:56.000
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.360
I'll be right down
to discuss it with you.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.600
You can go now.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.500
Chief.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.050
Can't you see I'm busy here?

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.200
Leave!

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.080
Yes.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.080
Constable Zhong,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.280
you're finally back.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.200
How is he doing now?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.550
After the acupuncture,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.870
his pulse has stabilized,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.960
but the frost toxin has drained

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.750
too much of his strength,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.510
so

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.240
he's still unconscious.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.000
He'll wake up.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.270
Didn't you say
that once the poison flares up,

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.320
he can't be saved?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.120
You've found a way to treat him?

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.600
Not yet.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.440
Though the flare-up is unavoidable,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.640
it happens in stages.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:06.840
The first attack

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.510
invades his flesh and blood.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.870
The second attack targets his organs.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.860
The third time, the toxin reaches

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.440
his bone marrow and meridians.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.750
After the third attack,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.150
he will die.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.550
Good thing this is only the first attack.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.680
There's still time.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.650
I will definitely

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:24.360
find the antidote

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.760
before the third attack.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:44.080
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.510
That's the situation.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.510
All I said is true.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.870
All the previous victims

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.200
were from brothels,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.200
and I thought Xiao Beiming would never

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.750
target them,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.710
so I didn't connect
the corpse-sewing cases

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:58.670
with the Fengbo Lake case

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.000
at all.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.480
That's why I didn't

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.910
report to you, Chief Zhuge.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.480
Chief,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.270
your tea is getting cold.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.000
Committing multiple murders

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.440
for a woman

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.840
really doesn't sound like

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.910
something Xiao Beiming would do.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.270
Exactly.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.150
That's why I'm

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.840
completely baffled.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.790
That's because you don't

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.480
understand Xiao Beiming at all.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.240
Oh?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.360
Young Master Zhuge,

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.400
do you care to enlighten us?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.390
Three years ago,

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.360
did anyone suspect

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:46.240
that Xiao Beiming was Yesha?

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.390
To me,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.360
nothing Xiao Beiming does

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.390
is surprising.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720
Our priority now

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.920
isn't to figure out

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.120
his motives

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.150
but to capture him

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.390
as soon as possible.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.220
So, Young Master Zhuge,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.500
you have a good plan
to find Xiao Beiming?

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.960
Go to Marquis Jingshan's Mansion.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:25.960
Did he say anything

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960
before he passed out?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.080
I took him to the pavilion

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.480
where Ajia was attacked.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.150
He examined

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.390
the scene thoroughly

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.630
and then suddenly said,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.760
"I understand now."

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.390
Understand what?

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.400
He collapsed
before finishing his sentence.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.240
You're awake.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.960
Careful.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.750
Ajia isn't dead, is he?

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:52.480
He's not dead,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.080
but he's close to it.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.960
His whole body was stitched through
with thick threads,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.910
with steel needles
in vital acupoints on his chest.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.150
Even the best physician in the capital

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.950
won't risk cutting the threads.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.150
That's not Ajia.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.390
That's Tailor.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.840
Tailor's ultimate target

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.500
isn't Ajia,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.770
but Marquis Jingshan.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.080
How do you know?

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.390
The fact that Marquis Jingshan appeared

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.440
at the sacrifice ritual

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.910
means that he not only knew
what Ajia had done

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.750
but also

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.150
chose to turn a blind eye.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.270
But the marquis

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.480
had two top fighters protecting him.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.010
Tailor couldn't get close.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:23.720
To kill the marquis,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.150
he'd have to be clever

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.270
and catch him completely off guard.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.910
I examined Ajia's courtyard.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.080
Tailor deliberately left the clue

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.550
about the salt and iron factory

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.750
so he'd be sent back

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.790
to the marquis's mansion

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.030
and kill the marquis.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.870
Wait.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.720
I'm going with you.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.600
No.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.870
You just had a flare-up.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.080
You're too weak now.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.720
You wait here.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.150
If Tailor shows up,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.200
I'll catch him myself.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.120
I've waited three years.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.240
I can't wait any longer.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.600
This is our best shot,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.670
and it might be my last.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.750

He didn't stay to fight

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.180
and jumped straight down.

Was it really Xiao Beiming?

00:17:23.109 --> 00:17:24.510
He looked exactly like Ajia.

get cornered on a cliff

the Blood-freezing Frost by mistake,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.720
he wouldn't have lost
all his martial arts skills;

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.160
he could've grabbed your melon mace

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.070
and wouldn't have fallen,

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.790
right?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.550
It's all my fault.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.000
It's all my fault. It's all my fault!

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.400
If only I had been skilled enough

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.200
to develop an antidote.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.720
If he hadn't been unconscious for so long,

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.790
we might have caught Tailor,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.680
and he wouldn't have chased him
to the cliff

from such a high cliff?

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.770
It was thanks to Tailor.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.060
There's a tunnel under the cliff?

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.110
I don't know who built it,

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.790
but it's definitely been there
for some time.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.300
And in the cave,

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.780
I made other discoveries.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.740
What discoveries?

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:26.350
Ajia's body

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.040
and this skin-like mask.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.960
I walked deeper into the cave

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.830
and surprisingly came out

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.690
on the other side of the mountain.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.030
So Tailor…

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.830
He must have discovered

00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:59.640
the cave long ago.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.240
That's why he ran to the cliff

00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:02.480
and jumped,

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.400
which was just part of his plan.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.440
No wonder there were no bodies

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.900
at the bottom of the cliff.

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.670
It's one scheme after another.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.030
Tailor has killed everyone

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.030
he wanted to kill,

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:14.139
and now he's vanished.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.400
All the suspicion

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:16.920
still falls on you.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.710
I already know who Tailor is.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.639
If Hibiscus was killed

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:23.670
by Hu Shisan,

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:25.190
her body would've been
dumped in the wilderness,

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.800
and he certainly wouldn't
have built her a grave

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.070
with hibiscus flowers in front of it.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.670
That grave was built by Tailor.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.610
Hu Shisan disappeared

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.139
because Tailor killed him.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.280
He sewed and murdered Hu
in front of the grave

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.590
to make him atone for his sins.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.800
Are you suggesting

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:38.190
that Tailor and Hibiscus...

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.960
Hibiscus managed to escape

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.150
from human traffickers,

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.440
which means she wasn't stupid.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.540
But instead of going straight

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.500
to the authorities

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.280
after escaping,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.320
she went home.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.780
So their relationship

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.880
was clearly not ordinary.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:48.670
Exactly.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.550
There must have been someone at her home

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.190
more trustworthy than the authorities—

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.800
someone who could protect her better.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.960
And these sewing murder cases

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.390
might be Tailor's way

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.650
of avenging Hibiscus.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.840
I think so too.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.880
Hibiscus's home

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.800
was in the remote outskirts.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.320
Totally deserted. No neighbors.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.400
When I went around asking,

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.550
no one had ever seen Hibiscus,

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.670
let alone Tailor.

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:42.590

I'm in charge of this case.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.300
I came to the crime scene

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.550
to check if anything was missed.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.030
Constable Zhong,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.590
shouldn't you be
at the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.920
What are you doing here?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.400
Someone wants to see you.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.190
Who wants to see me?

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.360
I do.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.360

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:16.400
You actually still remember me.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.030
I've been hunting you for 3 years.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:18.480
Your face

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.630
has long been burned into my memory.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.280
Long before I was wanted,

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.550
we had already met.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.550
Constable Zhong,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.350
Yesha is right here,
and you're not arresting him?

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.960
Zhong Xueman,

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.510
you've actually sided with Yesha.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:34.840
Don't you know

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:36.910
whether I'm Yesha or not?

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.510
Xiao Beiming

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:39.110
is the man who killed your father,

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:39.510
yet you've been

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.030
hiding him by your side all this time.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.920
You're blinded by love, aren't you?

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.440
You've been calling me the ringleader

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.360
for 3 years,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.400
and I've been your scapegoat
for just as long.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.860
Now that it's come to this,

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:50.920
why don't we lay it all out?

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.280
Fine.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.150
Let's lay it all out.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.610
The reason I suspect you

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.590
is first because you're a constable.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.000
That day when we were examining the body
in the morgue,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.920
a fire suddenly broke out,

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.050
nearly burning Constable Zhong

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.400
and Coroner Feng to death.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.350
That fire was clearly

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:12.400
set by someone,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.590
meant to stop Constable Zhong's
investigation.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.190
To start a fire
in the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.510
the arsonist had to be a member

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.000
of the unit.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.030
By that logic,

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.760
everyone in the unit is a suspect.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.510
First the four courtesans and Hu Shisan,

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.190
then Ajia and Marquis Jingshan,

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.000
and finally the jump at the cliff—

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.360
the whole plan was so complex

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.110
that you'd need to know

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:29.440
where every step led,

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.630
or better yet, be part of it

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:31.550
to ensure

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.590
nothing went wrong.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.030
But the corpse-sewing cases involved

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.840
many constables.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.510
The most difficult part

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.710
of your plan

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.190
was abducting Ajia,

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.230
impersonating him,

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.800
and then killing Marquis Jingshan.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.000
None of the constables involved

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.880
could've impersonated

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.280
two people at once.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.630
The last time I saw you

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.070
was outside the salt and iron factory.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.400
You used the patrol as a pretext

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.440
and disappeared.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.310
You didn't show up again
until the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:52.190
searched the cliff.

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.670
Chief, we didn't find any bodies

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.150
or blood traces
at the bottom of the cliff.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:56.000
Outside the salt and iron factory,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.150
I suddenly felt unwell,

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.800
so I went home to rest for a while.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.630
After I felt better,

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.000
I returned to join the search.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.960
Is there a problem with that?

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.320
But you weren't with the team,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.880
so how did you know

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.880
they chased the killer to the cliff?

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.550
Long before going
to the salt and iron factory,

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:10.510
you had already

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.440
given yourself away.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.590
If the Elite Constabulary Unit
hadn't found the clue

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.590
about the salt and iron factory,

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.320
your plan would've fallen apart.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.190
So you deliberately

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.960
left the cloth clue

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.030
in Ajia's courtyard.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.510
I found this piece of coarse cloth

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:20.920
in the thorns.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.150
It tastes salty.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.110
It makes me think of a warehouse

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.570
that stores salt and iron.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.880
If you want to frame someone,

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.230
you'll always find a way.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.890
I examined Ajia's courtyard.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.480
Judging by the bloodstains on the ground,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.030
the killer clearly chose a route

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.830
that passed through the thorns—

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.150
very deliberate.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:45.920
And that cloth strip

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.440
looked like it had been
intentionally torn off

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.480
and placed there.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.320
And the one who pointed out that strip…

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.320
is the killer.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.590
Since you know it so well,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.910
if I could do all that,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.710
so could you.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.590
And that's exactly your cleverest move.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:12.450
Because Yesha has always been me,

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.810
as long as you stayed hidden and uncaught,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.930
I'd always be seen as the killer

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.360
behind the corpse-sewing cases.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.670
But no matter how perfect your plan was,

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.110
you didn't expect me to come back.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.360
And you never imagined

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.550
that after you jumped off the cliff,

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.550
I'd jump too.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.550
I also found

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:26.230
the cave you used to escape.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:30.920
That explains

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.000
how you vanished

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:32.880
from the salt and iron factory

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.800
and still managed to show up

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.460
at the search site right away.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.460
It's because you were

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.860
around us the whole time.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:43.890
In that cave,

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.280
I found Ajia's body

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.030
and this skin-like mask.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.190
Just admit it.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.550
Even so, what can you do?

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.190
You have neither witnesses

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.990
nor evidence.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.230
This mask alone isn't enough

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.070
to convict me.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.590
The evidence is on you.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.710
To impersonate Ajia,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.800
you stitched steel needles

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.400
through your own body.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.630
Do you dare to take off your clothes?

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.230
As expected
of the Qi Kingdom's top constable.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:38.890
Your reputation is well-earned.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.030
I suffered serious injuries

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.320
to kill Marquis Jingshan.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:17.000
I'm no match for you anymore.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.960
I have no chance of beating you.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.550
Come back with me to admit your crimes.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.760
I can go back with you,

00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.240
but before we leave,

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.320
let me say goodbye

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.110
to this place.
