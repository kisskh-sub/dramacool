Dear.

learn that from?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.519

It's for my wife.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.840
Keep the change.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.439
Yes.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.319
This hairpin is both elegant

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:00.720
Are you all right, Young City Lord?

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.279
What's happened, Young City Lord?

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.680
What's the matter?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.399
Young City Lord!

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.839
Young City Lord!

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.959
What's this?

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:06.959
He was just fine.

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:07.759
Exactly.

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:08.560
What's happening?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.839
Why did he pass out?

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.319
Shen Wangchen.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.600
What's wrong with you?

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.319
I thought of
spending more time with you.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.920
Looks like

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.600
my wish isn't going to come true.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:31.759
No...

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.800
No...

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.839
No way.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.759
That won't do.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.079
Shen Wangchen.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:37.839
Don't just lie here.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.800

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.160
Get up and tell me about it.

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.000
Tell me

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.360
what's happened.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.639
- Chen!
- Shen Wangchen!

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.279
Mother.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
I'm all right.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.680
I'm fine.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.000
Shen Wangchen.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.839
What's the matter with you?

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.319
Why is this happening?

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.360
What's really happened?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.079
Tell me! Tell me!

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.160
You're scaring me, Shen Wangchen!

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.839
Get up first, Shen Wangchen!

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.240
Chen!

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.399
What are you trying to do?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.199
Shen Wangchen was aware

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.959
that Dayao's presence

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:25.360
would fasten
the erosion of the demon core.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.240
Why did he insist on doing so?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.319
Si Ming.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.759
Fate

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.439
is all destined.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.040
This

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.240
is beyond our control.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.639
Get up first.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.360
Tell me about it.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.920
Today,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.519
you all will meet your demise!

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.000
Shang Xin is actually

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.480
trying to nurture the double demon cores

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:29.839
seized from Fan Dayao
with the people's primordial spirit!

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:31.720
Then what are we waiting for?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.519
The demon cores are showing up.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.439
We'll get killed if we make a move now.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.360
Shen Wangchen.

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:53.680
You lied to me.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:55.639
You said

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:57.519
we wouldn't end up
like what we had in the past lives.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.360
I won't let you die on me.

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.199
Dayao.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.800
It's all my destiny.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:18.839
The double demon cores

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:23.319
only appear

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:25.480
during a life-and-death moment.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.399
What?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.279
Promise me.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.080
Return to Qianchun Mountain

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.360
and be a good chief.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.919
Please.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.600
I don't want...

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.720
I don't want that, Shen Wangchen!

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.840
I love you.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.120
Shen Wangchen.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.480
I don't want it!

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.320
Forget about the demon cores,
Shen Wangchen!

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.960
I can give up on everything!

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.879
I don't want the demon cores!

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.399
All I want is you!

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.159
Shen Wangchen!

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:15.879
Shen Wangchen!

Get up, Shen Wangchen!

00:09:20.919 --> 00:09:21.879
Shen Wangchen!

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:23.679
