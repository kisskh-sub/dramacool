[Episode 27]

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.490
[Registry of Haiya Orphans]

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.120
Why are there

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.650
so many orphans from Haiya?

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.120
Huo Zongyao,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.920
female infant, Huo Dairong.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.280
Miao Jie,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.840
male infant, Miao Yun.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.310
Zhong Yunchi,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480
male infant…

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.400
Xiao Beiming.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.710
S-So Beiming is also…

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.560
Actually, after learning

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.960
that Master once served
in the Canfeng Army,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.750
I began

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.120
to question my origins.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.329
Now that it's confirmed,

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:20.930
at least I have some closure.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.930
But don't worry.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.670
Whether I'm an orphan from Haiya or not,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.960
it won't change anything

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.560
I've set out to do.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.079
[Tong Xin, male infant, Tong Peng]

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:31.960
Tong Xin?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.380
My father was in the Canfeng Army,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.310
and my second brother was a Haiya orphan?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.510
How is that possible?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.520
If Old Master Tong served
in the Canfeng Army,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.280
then the massacre
at Pingyuan Escort Agency

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.030
was likely Yesha's revenge.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.470
It says here
that Tong Peng was your second brother.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.329
Why have you never mentioned him?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.750
My second brother passed away accidentally

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.030
before the massacre.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.000
I had no idea

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.200
he was a Haiya orphan.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.310
Brute,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.960
at least now you know who your enemy is.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.020
Don't be too upset.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.240
I'm fine.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.280
It's just that this bastard Yesha—

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.190
I have to catch him with my own hands.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.000
I'll go look into

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.750
everyone on this list right now.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.000
We'll go with you.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.910
Beiming,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.810
you stay here and wait for news.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.270
The ones who adopted Haiya orphans

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.040
were not ordinary soldiers back then.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.079
[Wei Residence]

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.079
They were at least battalion commanders.

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.120
So the military still

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.079
keeps processed files

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.280
like Chu Guangsha's,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.190
which let us trace

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.050
where they went after discharge.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.460
Apart from the twenty-some
who stayed in the capital,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.680
[Tong Xin, male infant, Tong Peng]

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.560
they moved
to different parts of the country.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.150
In the past few days, we visited

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.470
those who stayed in the capital

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.200
and found, without exception,

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.030
that they were all dead.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.310
[Wei Zhongfu] [Wei Hai]

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.320
And the ones not in the capital?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.800
Same result.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.120
Over the past decade or so,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.030
they all died for various reasons.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.000
Most of them

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
either went missing or died of illness.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.470
They were scattered across the country,

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.150
with no apparent connections,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.370
so no one would notice

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.560
or report it to the authorities.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.430
If we hadn't investigated

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.480
the Huo family case

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.120
and gone to Weizhou for the Yellow Heaven,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.399
no one would have connected

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.730
these deaths together.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.950
And those Haiya orphans?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.080
The orphans who were adopted back then

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.460
all died for various reasons,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.160
just like Tong Shuang's brother.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.120
As for the rest,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.040
apart from you and Dairong,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.390
all are missing.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.920
The missing ones

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.070
must have been taken by Yesha.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.000
Some became

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.720
Zhu Yitie, Qing Ying,

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.120
and Huang Wuchang.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.159
Xueman,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.600
when did the first death occur?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.210
The ninth year of Xingwen.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.510
So Yesha started his revenge

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.190
13 years ago.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.070
What a grand scheme he's been weaving.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.920
Now that the registry

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.159
is a dead end,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.160
what should we do next?

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.200
The trail isn't cold yet.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.440
[Zhang Guangquan,
male infant, Zhang Weinan]

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.970
[Tong Xin, male infant, Tong Peng]

[Zhong Yunchi,

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.800
[Zhong Yunchi,
male infant, Xiao Beiming]

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.330
There's a hidden seal on it.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.630
Military confidential documents

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:36.960
must bear a hidden seal.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.630
[Prince of Pingnan, Wu Lie]

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.480
This is…

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.040
Prince of Pingnan,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.120
Wu Lie?

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.000
I've always felt there was

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.950
something off about this registry.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.270
With so many names on it,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.070
it looks like it was meant

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:50.000
for someone to review.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.870
I kept wondering,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.920
who was it for?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.720
You mean…

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.360
the leader of the Canfeng Army?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.070
Exactly.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.720
My father and General Huo

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.750
held positions no higher

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.070
than vice commander at the time.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.000
Taking the Haiya orphans

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.190
was such a significant matter.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.630
They couldn't have
made that decision alone.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.430
So,

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.040
having Prince of Pingnan's name here

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.030
makes perfect sense.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.510
Otherwise,

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.040
they couldn't have brought
the orphans back.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.120
Wu Lie, Prince of Pingnan, was

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.510
the late emperor's sixth younger brother.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.840
That makes him His Majesty's sixth uncle.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.190
Wu Lie joined the army at a young age

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.310
and had defended the border ever since,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.270
but official records about him are scarce,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.430
which makes it very likely

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.390
that he was the one

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.070
commanding the Canfeng Army.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.560
Where is he now?

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.000
Dead.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.560
Dead?

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.190
According to official records,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.600
in the early years of Xingwen,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.040
he returned to the capital,
fell ill, and died.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.159
But I don't think

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.270
it's that simple.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.480
What do you mean?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.270
His death was

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.950
way too quiet.

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.310
I checked the Ministry of Rites' records
from that year.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.159
By rights,

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.750
as His Majesty's uncle

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.000
and Prince of Pingnan,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.190
even without a state funeral,

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.040
his burial

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.370
should have been grand.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.630
Yet the Ministry of Rites

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.040
has no record of it at all.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.510
Not even

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.830
where he was buried.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.390
Could it be that he was just low-key

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.480
and didn't want a grand funeral?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.750
What about the Imperial Infirmary?

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.870
A royal was seriously ill,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.870
but the Imperial Infirmary

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.430
had no medical records about it.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.720
Isn't that odd?

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.040
You're saying the official records

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.870
are fake?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.630
I never said that.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:15.360
I just

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.160
found these things suspicious.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.000
He was the leader
of the Canfeng Army after all.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.630
Slaughtering an entire city

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.600
was such a hideous crime.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.160
Could His Majesty have

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.630
executed him secretly?

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.160
A royal committed crimes.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.750
Covering it up would be understandable.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.470
But why was he the only one killed?

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.720
His vice commanders—

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.000
whether my master

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.159
or General Huo—

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.680
both held high positions

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.190
in court after the Haiya Case.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.920
Even Old Master Tong went back to Weizhou

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.430
and ran a thriving escort agency.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.159
If not for Yesha's appearance,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.440
they wouldn't have died.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.950
You mean Wu Lie isn't dead,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.950
and we just don't know where he went?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.120
If he's really in hiding,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.870
the world's a big place—

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.240
was kidnapped by human traffickers.

Tell me—

which of them didn't give their all

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.070
for the Qi Kingdom?

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:56.310
Which of them
didn't give their heart and soul

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:57.160
to the Qi Kingdom?

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.110

But what happened after that?

Most of them were rootless

and suffered a lot,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.440
and their adoptive parents
died unnatural deaths.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.880
They were taken by Yesha,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.200
brainwashed into swearing loyalty to him,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.000
and willingly serving him
in revenge against the Qi Kingdom,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.240

only to cover up your hypocrisy

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:55.480
and mask your cowardice!

about atoning for your sins,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.400
I'll atone for you.

You're so much like your master.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.760
was just made up

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.550
to cover

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:04.880
the Canfeng Army's secret.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.710
That woodcutter must have been mistaken.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.110
No way there are real monsters.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:08.920
Exactly.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.670
No monsters.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.550
Don't worry.

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:11.280
With me here,

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.070
no monster

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.200
would dare harm you.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.320
Stop being lovey-dovey.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.510
Let's go.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:17.150
Be careful.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.630
Okay.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.030
I'll be right back.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.630
Be careful.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.440
Let's go.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.280
Dear Madman,

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:29.630
if I get scared later,

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.890
you have to protect me.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.630
I'll definitely bring back

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:33.920
some game for her.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.680
Let's go.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.320
What is that?
