[Capital of Qi]

souls break beneath the iron rule of law.

In the halls of power,

lie secret weapons

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.070
lurking in the dark.

Dark relics haunt the land,

in honor of the 48 loyal ministers

who had served the court for many years,

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.770

a tall pavilion

[In harmony with heaven and earth]

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.710
and named it Lang Hua Pavilion.

Within the pavilion, one's position is set by order of merit.

However,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.770
something extremely strange happened

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.190
in front of everyone when
the Emperor brought his ministers

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.910
to visit Lang Hua Pavilion

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.079
on the day of its opening.

Tears of blood flowed from the statues of
the 4 distinguished ministers.

This is a bad omen.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.280
The Emperor

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.120
ordered all who knew to stay silent.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.710

Get Lin Kang here.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.880
You are Lin Shu's cousin, Lin Kang?

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.870
You said that after Lin Shu was paralyzed due to illness,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.000
his temperament changed and became violent

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.480
as he was full of despair

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.680
and was unwilling to live on.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.480
So he begged you to help him

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.830
end his life.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.090
After repeated pleas, you ended his pain

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.640
to preserve his dignity.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.720
Yes.

My Lord, you are wise.

You're lying.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.920
If you really

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.310
could not bear to do it,

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.510
you must have been panicking.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.120
Each stab should have been unpredictable.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.430
But after the coroner examined the body,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.120
the wounds on the victim were found to

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.180
have concentrated on the left chest.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.870
There were no other wounds elsewhere.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.040
It only goes to show how

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.070
calm and collected you were
when you stabbed him.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.720
Also,

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.800
you chose to kill him

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.070
on a rainy day was because

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.530
you wanted to use the sound

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.950
of the thunderstorm
to cover up the murder.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.000
My Lord,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.370
Lin Shu and I were like real brothers.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.870
After Lin Shu was paralyzed,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:50.510
I took care of him personally.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.710
I prepared all his meals meticulously.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.070
With all I have done for him,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.950
how could I possibly murder him?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.830
Meticulous?

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.680
But why is it that I found husk residue

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.870
within the bed crevice?

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.310
You ate lavishly yourself,

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:03.870
while he's been

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.160
fed worse than a beggar.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:05.870
Besides,

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.310
the coroner found that

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.800
his back and bum

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.070
were full of sores.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.310
Is this your so-called

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.430
meticulous care?

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.310
You said Lin Shu changed a lot.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.000
But even with his lower body is paralyzed,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
he stretched his arm to feed

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.830
the sparrows on the windowsill

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.430
with his own meagre rations.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.000
He was that kind.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.120
And yet you said he was
being violent and unpredictable?

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.040
No, this is just your speculation!

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.390
After Lin Shu was paralyzed,

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.680
you moved into the Lin Mansion

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.870
and lived like you were the Master.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:30.600
You dismissed his servants

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.200
and tortured him.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.460
Seeing how strong-willed he was to live,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.400
you then thought of killing him.

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:37.870
After Lin Shu died,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.720
you couldn't even wait past

have the title deed changed.

in your killing of Lin Shu.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.440
You did so not to end his pain,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.840
but because you were

Scholar Zhang did suffocate to death.

called Blue-Eyed Silver Rat.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.200
This rat's poison

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.360
can cause difficulty breathing

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.320
and eventually suffocate to death.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.120
It looks just like a lung disease.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.870
And this poison

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.430
cannot be detected with the usual methods.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.360
We have to wait for a day and a night.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.440
Jiang Yi.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.320
Go back

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.750
and press a bun on the wound.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.000
If the bun turns black,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
we can catch them.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.910
Arrest who?

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.630
The Blue-Eyed Silver Rat loves to eat
purple snakeberries.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.630
In the whole Zhang Mansion,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.200
only his wife's nails

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.030
were purple.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.000
That rat should be

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.030
in an earthen pot in her room.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.150
Be careful when you arrest her.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.150
Don't get bitten.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.340
I'll get going.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.550
That courtesan case

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.240
caused quite a stir not long ago.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.200
Using the statement

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.240
from her neighbor Niu Lao'er,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.400
I sketched out a potrait

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.080
of this thief.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.510
Take a look.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:43.270
Should we put up a

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.720
citywide manhunt notice?

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.620
You can put it up,
but there's no need for a search.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.510
Why?

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.430
Because there is no such person.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.440
The wound on the courtesan’s neck

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.440
didn’t have any outward-tearing flesh.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.510
Yet the flesh atop the head

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.380
was torn and turned outward.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.120
It means

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.270
she died of a head injury,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.360
but someone disguised it as a throat slit.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.600
There was a knife at the scene,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.630
but there were no blood stains
at the point of impact.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.690
If that's the case,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.270
she didn't die at home.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.790
Then who could be the murderer?

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.390
Since

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.720
the crime scene is fake,

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:09.200
the man who claimed to have seen

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.720
a robber entering a house and killing her,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.240
and even saw the robber's true identity,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.310
is also fake.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.200

Put this sketch up.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:16.230
When he sees it,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.550
he will think that we believe him.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.510
He will then let his guard down

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.200
to go and retrieve

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.700
the loot he had stolen and hidden away.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.630
I'll go keep an eye on him

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.090

in Sea Cliff all those years ago...

The reason I dared make such a promise

When someone dies
harboring deep resentment,

their soul cannot find rest
or reincarnate.

Instead, they become a vengeful spirit,
trapped among the living.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.600
When that hatred
runs as deep as the ocean,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.590
and their wrath fills the very heavens,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.440
they are called Yesha.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.030
It's said that Yesha claims lives

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.430
without leaving a trace.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.030
Beiming,

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.340
you're better at solving cases

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.270
than I am,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.720
but when it comes to popular stories
and legends,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.110
I've read way more than you.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.830
Besides,

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.810
Yesha killed several officials

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.200
but didn't take any valuables.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.460
So it wasn't for money,

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.640
but for revenge.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.000
Am I right?

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.070
Partially.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480
I think everything Yesha

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.440
has done so far

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.960
was to spread rumors.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.000
If it were just for revenge,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.500
there was no need

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:06.920
to tamper with the statue.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.550
He wants everyone to believe

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.590
that Yesha has come,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.200
and the fall of the Qi Kingdom is near.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.600
This person's ambitions

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.190
go far beyond

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:14.920
a few lives.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.400
But he caused such a big mess.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:19.410
Isn't he afraid that if he fails,

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.900
he'll fall into our hands?

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.130
Yesha prides himself on his cleverness,

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.030
thinking he's planned every move.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.040
But there's one thing

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.300
he didn't account for.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.160
What's that?

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.550
Me.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.960
So is it him that's arrogant,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.340
or you?

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.310
Don't worry.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.590
I'll outwit him.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.680
Let's go.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.460
Go where?

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.480
It's already dark.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.480
Home, of course.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.920
But we haven't found anything yet.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.600
Even so, we need some rest.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.740
Tomorrow morning,

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.000
we'll head to Mandarin Duck Restaurant.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.200
For what?

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.830
Is there a case
at Mandarin Duck Restaurant too?

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.000
We're going there

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.480
to get someone her favorite treat,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.140
the very first batch of
peach blossom pastries.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.110
Xueman.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.960
Forceps.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.640
Catch it.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.670
[Yesha]

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.600
Mr. Shen,

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:14.050
even though you've been reassigned,

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.750
[Shen Mansion]

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.960
your safety must come first.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.200
Please report to His Majesty

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.070
and stay in the capital for now.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.480
Ridiculous!

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.590
If Yesha really wants to kill me,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.400
how long can you guard me for?

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.200
One year?

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.200
Or ten years?

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480
Am I to live

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.710
my entire life

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:33.240
under your watch,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.440
like one of

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.160
your prisoners?

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:39.110
Enough.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.400
I am willing to devote my remaining years

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.800
to the good of the nation.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.160
Tomorrow morning,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.770
I must leave for my new post.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:46.750
Mr. Shen.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.750
Master.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.680
Mr. Shen is right.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.870
Keeping him here

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.200
won't change anything.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:52.890
Beiming.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:53.590
Master,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.720
I have a plan

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.810
that can ensure Mr. Shen's safety.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.310
Xiao Beiming ran

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.670
all over the city today,

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.310
but it was all just a blur.

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.640
What useful leads could he possibly find?

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:06.880
Even though His Majesty

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.160
assigned this case
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.550
we of the Secret Investigation Unit

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.270
must not stand idly by.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.220
For years,

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.270
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.920
has been outshining us.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.800
If they crack this case,

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.030
our future

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.720
will be even bleaker.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.000
You're right, Father.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.210
This case is of great importance.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.270
If we can solve it

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.240
before Xiao Beiming does,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.640
His Majesty will surely reward us,

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.790
not punish us.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.640
It's a golden opportunity.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.650
We must seize it.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.520
But since the case

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:46.730
has already been handed over
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:47.800
we can't

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:49.630
conduct an open investigation.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.540
So how are we supposed to gather clues?

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.160
Why did you support

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.460
[Shen Mansion]

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.440
Mr. Shen's departure from the capital?

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.230
Once he's gone,

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.400
we won't be able to protect him.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.650
Tomorrow is the third day.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.520
If something happens,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.650
we'll be in trouble.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.920
Of course I know that.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.880
Then you…
So you need to find Master as soon as possible

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.640
and stay at the Shen Mansion with them

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.160
to ensure Mr. Shen's safety.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.310
Are you hiding something

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.790
from me?

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:13.730
Of course not.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.830
By the way, Xueman,

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.360
do you have any money on you?

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.910
Since you're not telling me anything,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:18.550
I won't give you any money.

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.060
It's not that I'm hiding it.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.070
The time just isn't right yet.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.390
I have something important to do,

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.370
and I'll explain everything
once I'm back, okay?

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:24.920
Beiming.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.480
[Shen Mansion]

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.550
Fang Yin's in trouble at the gambling den.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.810
Xueman, I really have to go.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.070
I'll talk to you later.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.620
Wait...

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.550
[Shen Mansion]

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.270
Money!

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.510
Don't move.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:44.350
I will pay you back!

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.740
I swear in the name of

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.030
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:48.310
Let me go.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.000
Your savior's here.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.030
Beiming!

00:28:58.050 --> 00:28:59.550
Beiming, help me!

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.510
Zhuge is going to chop off my finger!

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:02.430
Spill it.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.850
What scheme are you playing this time?

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.250
Your junior bet against me

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.310
and lost 500 taels.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.960
Now he says he doesn't have the money.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.760
By the rules of the gambling den,

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.530
he's got to chop off five fingers

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:15.530
to pay his debt.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.920
Beiming.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.350
Don't believe him!

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.440
He set me up!

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.670
I told you not to move!

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.000
Five hundred taels?

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.720
Even if I sold
all of the Elite Constabulary Unit's land,

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.400
I still couldn't pay that back.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.790
Five fingers for 500 taels?

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.360
That's a fair trade.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.440
Chop them off.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.340
Xiao Beiming.

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.950
How could you say that?

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.270
My uncle is the deputy chief
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.480
If you stand by and do nothing,

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.970
he won't let you off!

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.680
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.300
You walked right into

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.690
a trap yourself.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.540
How could your uncle

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.920
blame me for that?

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:46.000
Besides,

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.480
that's 500 taels.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.920
Five fingers?

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.650
That's a bargain.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.920
If I were Mr. Zhuge,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.540
I'd take all ten.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.590
Beiming,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.800
he is our colleague.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.240
Please help him out.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.510
Senior.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.790
This bastard

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.270
always uses his uncle's position

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.090
to cause us

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.830
trouble.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.720
If he loses his hand,

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.270
he can't be a constable anymore.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.750
That would save us a lot of headaches

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.000
when solving cases.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.270
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.570
may I ask

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:26.990
what's going on up ahead?

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:28.510
You don't know?

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.400
Mr. Qian is hosting

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.150
a birthday banquet just up the street.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.130
Anyone who visits

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.190
and says a few auspicious words

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.710
gets a red envelope.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760
No time to talk.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.440
If I'm late, I'll miss out!

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.930
Such a lively scene.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.600
Li Long,

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.280
go get some men
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.510
What's wrong, Young Master?

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.510
That big crowd earlier wasn't normal.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.550
It's very likely Yesha has already

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:51.190
seen through

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.670
the decoy of the four carriages.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:53.960
If they're going to strike,

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.880
going out of the city
is the best time to act.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.480
Why are we helping

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.140
the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.170
We are helping ourselves.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.430
If Xiao Beiming tries to make a getaway,

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:05.280
we'll wait to

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.760
ambush him from behind.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.870
Brilliant plan, Young Master.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.660
Beiming,

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.320
we're about to leave the city.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.280
Be careful.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.740
The real danger starts once we're outside.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.400
Got it.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.530
Mr. Shen.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:29.400
Mr. Shen!

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.920
Mr. Shen!

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.400
Mr. Shen!

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.770
What happened?

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.920
Just now, amid the confusion,

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.170
someone shot a steel needle

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:43.530
through the window,

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.450
piercing Mr. Shen's vital point.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.780
He died instantly, without a sound.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.020
Yesha is a true master of hidden weapons.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.320
Xiao Beiming,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.400
you lost the bet this time.
