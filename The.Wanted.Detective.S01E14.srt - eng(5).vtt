Chu Guangsha's matter

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.990
has nothing to do with me.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.730
If it has nothing to do with you,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.280
then why did you escape at night?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.750
I just went down the mountain
to enjoy the moonlight.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.000
Is that a crime too?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.130
You're still lying.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.710
Do you think

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.840
we wouldn't find out about

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.680

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.000
Riding to Guangsha Villa

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.750
saves at least

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.070
two hours of travel time.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.120
Where did you go

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.450
during these two hours?

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.470
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.290
Still won't talk, huh?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.150
I'll talk!

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.950
I'll tell you.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.770
Where did you go?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.310
I went to have a meal.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.310
Just a meal, that's all.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.000
Still not telling the truth?

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.590
If it was just a meal,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.560
why did you lie and deceive us?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.910
I ate meat.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.840
Qingtai Mountain rules state

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.150
that disciples must practice austerity,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.210
and eating meat is a major violation.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.750
But I really couldn't control

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.150
my gluttony.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.710
Every time I deliver pills,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.800
I sneak to a restaurant to eat meat.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.000
Since you broke the rules,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.600
you can just leave the order,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.590
so why choose to run away?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.030
Our discipline is extremely strict.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.310
If you break the rules,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.280
you'll be caned.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.470
I've broken the rules so many times.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.710
Those dozens of strikes would cripple me,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.910
if not kill me.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.590
I was afraid you'd discover it
during your investigation.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.910
How could I not run?

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.200
Which restaurant did you go to?

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.120
What's it called? Where is it?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.030
It's the Qingmu Inn,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.440
not far from Qingtai Mountain.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.800
The matter of Chu Guangsha's pills

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.310
truly has nothing

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.470
to do with me at all.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.960
Everything I've said is true.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.240
If needed,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.970
the innkeeper can vouch for me.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.040
Come with me.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.910
Repeat what you

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.710
just said.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.510
He just went to a restaurant?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.560
He didn't seem

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.950
to be lying,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.800
and he has no motive

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.190
to kill Chu Guangsha.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.190
If what he said was true...

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.310
If the restaurant was crowded

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.120
and Immortal Jiu's attention

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.950
was on that fish dish or whatever,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.000
the pill could easily

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.600
have been switched

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.930
when he wasn't looking.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.000
I'm getting

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.020
more and more confused

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.950
about this case.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.750
Chu Guangsha and General Huo

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.610
were comrades,

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.390
yet they mysteriously

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.920
had these financial dealings

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.000
and died one after another

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.120
with the same cause of death.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.120
It's baffling.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.150
Doesn't that just mean

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.800
that the killer in both cases

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.750
is likely the same person?

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.190
Are you trying to say again

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.870
that it's Miss Huo?

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.750
Impossible.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.950
was switched

during delivery,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.560
then Miss Huo

was with us the whole time,

so she had no opportunity to do it.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.480
That's what puzzles me too.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.160
I can't figure it out either.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.120
Any findings from the Ghost Market?

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.650
You went looking for Old...

The old man?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.540
Couldn't find him.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.080
But I found the Ghost Market's keeper.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680
What do you want?

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.210
Nothing much.

Speak honestly.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.750
She told me

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.280
that after the old man left,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.760
he never showed up again.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.190

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.720
full of tricks.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.190

What do you think

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.130
this symbol means?

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.120
This...

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.270
It's just an ordinary personal seal.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.680

If similar medicine bottles

appear in the capital,

How's your investigation going?

The pill made by the old Immortal Master

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.680
from Qingtai Mountain

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.270
and the one Chu Guangsha actually took

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.150
are completely different.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.550

I was with you the whole time

and had no chance to switch the pills.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.950
So now, my suspicion

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.920
can be cleared, right?

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.520
Of course,

we're both your witnesses.

Miss Huo,

do you recognize this symbol?

Now that he's gone,

Madam, you don't have to

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.720
stay up and make tea for him anymore.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.920
It's useless to keep this teabag.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.040

The pills that doctor gave my mother

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.250
had the same symbol on them.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.320
The box is still at the Huo Mansion.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.000
So you're saying

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.680
that doctor has something to do with

Solving crimes isn't my specialty,

But Chu Guangsha's private ledger

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.270
On the 15th of each month,

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.310
he enters through this back door

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.560
directly into this room.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.760
This back door is normally kept closed.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.700
He sits right in this spot.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:41.510
I always

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.770
prepare his favorite dishes in advance.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.270
After the meal...

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.150
This way, please.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.000
After the meal,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.960
he leaves directly through the back door.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.000
He mounts the horse

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.660
I prepare for him and departs.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.270
You're quite meticulous in your work.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.390
It seems Immortal Jiu

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.190
must be quite generous with you.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.670
Oh, it's nothing.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.330
Nothing worth mentioning.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.510
From what you're saying,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.390
Immortal Jiu

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.000
really doesn't come into contact
with many people.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
That's correct.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.510
These contracts and receipts

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.440
are from the Ministry of War
and the Ministry of Works.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.480
In the early years,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.270
the borders of Qi Kingdom were unstable

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.320
and had frequent battles.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.120
Guangsha Villa first made its fortune

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.670
by trading ironware.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.120
These were

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.960
all sold to the Ministry of War
and the Ministry of Works.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.870
Why did the ministries

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.080
need ironware for?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.270
To make weapons.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.600
This also included

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.320
General Huo's authorization.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.120
General Huo had always
worked in the Ministry of War,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:00.910
while Chu Guangsha

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.840
was once under General Huo's command,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.440
so he must've been involved.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.550
That's an abuse of power.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.390
The army needed weapons.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.510
As long as the quality was good

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.600
and the price was fair,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.630
what's wrong with that?

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.150
Then Chu Guangsha

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.150
regularly transferring money
to the Huo household

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.610
is certainly suspicious.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.720
What other issues are in these ledgers?

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.550
Later,

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.670
Guangsha Villa's business

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.670
grew larger and larger,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.400
and their wealth accumulated.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.100
But I discovered that,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.840
besides the money sent to
the Huo household,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.000
Guangsha Villa

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.360
also transferred a large sum

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.270
to Weizhou.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.270
Weizhou?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.000
The ledgers don't show

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.510
where exactly in Weizhou

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.060
or who received the money.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.510
How did Weizhou

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.750
get involved in this?

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.550
I can't figure it out either.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.080
Chu Guangsha sending money to my dad

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.150
makes some sense,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.480
but such a large sum

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.440
transferred to Weizhou,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.150
without any

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.480
business connections,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.030
is truly puzzling.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.750
Investigating Chu Guangsha's death

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.010
might give us answers.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.200
Matches what I found.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.120
Immortal Jiu said that during the meal,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.630
the pill was with him the entire time,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.390
he didn't drink alcohol,

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.670
and had no contact with other customers.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.910
In such circumstances,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:03.840
trying to secretly

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.200
swap the pill he was carrying

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.600
seems completely impossible.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.870
This is very strange.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.910
What should we do now?

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.670
Let's go.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.120
It's almost time.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.030
Where to?

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.160
We'll retrace the pill's delivery path.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.790
[Baiyun Temple]

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.630
Even if we need to investigate,

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.200
is it really necessary

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.510
to retrace the steps in person?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.320
It'll take several hours.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.000
If we don't walk it ourselves,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.480
how can we spot anything suspicious?

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.200
Let's go.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.390
Hey,

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.320
you're still suspecting Miss Huo?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.390
[Qingyun Terrace]

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.750
This is where Immortal Jiu

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.750
always stops

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.030
when delivering the pill.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.630
He always dines in this room.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.960
If what he says is true,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.750
he really doesn't come into contact
with many people.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:47.360
Indeed.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.150
There are very few travelers
on this route.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.630
Besides, Immortal Jiu keeps the pill

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.630
in his pocket at all times.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.200
Even if the greatest thief alive tried,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.360
it would be impossible to switch them

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.620
without him noticing.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.180
Change horses.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.800
Let's go to Guangsha Villa.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:22.720
The time matches.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.630
My Lords,

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.600
is there anything

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600
I can help you with?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.440
Steward Li,

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.550
could you tell us

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.840
if Mr. Chu always personally received

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.750
the pill upon delivery?

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.440
Yes,

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.350
every single time, without exception.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.390
Then where would Mr. Chu go

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.440
after receiving it?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.630
Mr. Zhuge,

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.360
the questions you're asking today

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.270
were already

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.340
asked yesterday by Officer Zhong

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.790
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:50.670
Moreover,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.920
she arrested one of my disciples away.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.480
I'm sorry.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.220
Could you tell me again

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.670
in detail what happened?

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.340
Please come in.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.120
The officials have ordered

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.550
that until the case is solved,

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.120
none of us are allowed in here.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.870
So after Mr. Chu's death,

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.240
all these doors have been kept locked.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.960
Steward Li,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:21.510
may I take a look inside?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.000
Please go ahead, My Lord.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.910
Steward Li,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.510
may I open this?

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.970
As you wish, My Lord.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.080
The items in the chest

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.200
should be what Mr. Chu had used

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.660
for worshipping deities.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.030
This must be the box

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.470
that held the immortality pill, right?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.530
That's correct.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.960
Why have you

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.720
come back again?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.750
Miss Huo,

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.350
what's going on here?

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.390
Since we buried Madam,

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.000
I've dismissed

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
all the servants.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.360
The disciples

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.340
have all gone to join the army too.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.600
I plan to sell this mansion

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600
and find a smaller place

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.660
for Qing Ying and myself to settle in.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:30.750
Is there new progress in the case?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.360
We came here

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.890
precisely for that matter.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.270
Please, go ahead.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.910
Regarding Chu Guangsha's death,

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.010
we've actually been under a misconception

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:37.720
all this time,

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.550
believing that the pill

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.440
was switched during delivery.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.670
If that were true,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.360
then you, Miss Huo,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.670
would be completely above suspicion.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.200
But it wasn't until

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.630
I found this box

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.120
in Chu Guangsha's room

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:48.600
that I understood

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.060
the killer's true method.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.200
What's wrong with this box?

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:02.240
Open it.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.070
How is this possible?

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.030
Close it and open it again.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.550
It's a mechanism box?

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.270
Exactly.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.200
The killer only needed to

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.840
place the poison inside beforehand

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.550
and deliver it to Qingtai Mountain.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.200
When the old Immortal Master opened it,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.150
he thought it was empty,

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.550
so he put the pill inside.

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.550
But as soon as the box was closed,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.670
the mechanism automatically

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.600
pulled the top layer to the bottom.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.360
When it was delivered to Chu Guangsha,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.510
he could only see

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:34.710
the poison in the box.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:44.080
So you're saying

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.510
the pill was switched

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.040
right when it was produced?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.480
Then let's quickly find out

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.000
who made this box.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.510
Chu Guangsha had specifically ordered

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.390
a jade shop to produce these jade boxes.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.790
This is the box we got

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.840
from the shop.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960
I've examined it.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.460
It's just an ordinary box.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.840
If the box isn't the issue,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.270
then how did this mechanism box

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.080
get delivered to

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.270
the old Immortal Master?

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.080
It's simple.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.120
It's just like the principle
of this mechanism box,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.790
hiding the truth in plain sight.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.080
Early morning on the 15th of each month,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.150
I promptly deliver the box
to Qingtai Mountain

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.600
before the immortality pill is ready.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.360
Where on Qingtai Mountain?

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.120
At the foot of the mountain.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.580
An Immortal Master comes down
to receive it.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.670
The box was indeed

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.320
delivered early morning
on the 15th every month.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.320
The owner of the jade shop

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.080
personally delivered it
to the foot of the mountain.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.240
But yesterday,

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.840
it was just a servant
who delivered the box.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.300
They came up the mountain.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:30.440
Up the mountain?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.590
That's right.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.940
As soon as I left the temple,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.320
[Baiyun Temple]

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.510
I ran into him here.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.670
I thought at the time

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.300
they might be a new worker.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.390
They saved me the trouble of going down.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.390
I understand now.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.550
The person delivering the box

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.960
delivered it to the foot of the mountain,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.200
but the person receiving it

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.080
got it at the entrance
of Qingtai Mountain.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.510
The culprit first disguised themself

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.000
as an Immortal Master
from Qingtai Mountain,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.960
deceiving the jade shop owner

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.320
at the foot of the mountain.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.670
Then they disguised themself as a worker,

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.270
delivering the mechanism box

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:56.150
to the Immortal Master
at Qingtai Mountain.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.600
What a clever deception!

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.080
You're indeed clever.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.960
But even if we know how it was done,

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.640
we still can't identify
who the culprit is.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.720
Not necessarily.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.040
You know who the culprit is?

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.030
Miss Huo,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.859
how much longer
are you planning to keep hiding?

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.750
[Baiyun Temple]

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.350
You still suspect me?

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.960
The day Chu Guangsha died,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.400
I was

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.550
with you the entire time.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.550
Aren't you mistaken?

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.310
No, we aren't.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.160
Miss Huo,

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.400
do you remember what happened

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.310
when we first went to

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.370
Qingtai Mountain?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.400
So you're saying

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.200
the only people who had access
to the immortality pill

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.440
were the old Immortal Master,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.030
you, and Chu Guangsha?

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.110
No, Miss Huo,

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.270
I only delivered the pill.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.270
I never actually touched it.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.940
None of us

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.790
ever introduced ourselves

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:55.880
to Immortal Jiu,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.270
yet he immediately addressed you

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:58.400
as Miss Huo.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.510
This proves the people
of Qingtai Mountain

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.400
already knew you.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.920
So I had Tong Shuang investigate

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.550
those servants

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.200
you dismissed from the Huo Mansion.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.480
The people at the Huo Mansion said

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.210
that since Madam Feng fell ill,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.880
you've been going to Qingtai Mountain

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.160
on the 15th of every month

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.310
to pray for Madam Feng's health.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.200
Is this true?

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.590
If the pill was indeed

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:14.880
switched during delivery,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.720
you wouldn't
have had the opportunity.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.750
But if you went

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.440
to Qingtai Mountain early in the morning,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.440
then rushed back to the Huo Mansion,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.070
and finally joined us

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.400
to go to Guangsha Villa,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.680
you could've made it in time

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.830
by riding quickly.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.880
This...

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.270
The old Immortal Master also mentioned

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.350
that Chu Guangsha
had been taking this pill

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:30.310
for quite some time.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.510
For someone who visits
Qingtai Mountain monthly,

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:32.240
you could

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:33.680
easily learn about

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.070
the pill delivery process.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.000
Moreover,

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.720
your disguise skills

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.830
are unmatched.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.480
Disguising as the old Immortal Master

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.510
or Immortal Jiu

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.830
is no challenge for you.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.200
You used the pretext
of investigating your background

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.790
to come with us to Guangsha Villa.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.680
It was just to make us

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.510
become your best alibis.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.070
These are all your speculations.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.110
You don't have any actual proof.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.720
No.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.020
There is evidence.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.920
This Beauty Snow

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.480
has helped us greatly.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.110
Do you still remember the Immortal Master

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.000
who picked up the box?

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.460
Could you recognize them?

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.000
I can't remember the face clearly,

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.790
but it's a different Immortal Master
who picks up the box

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:07.720
each time.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.880
I remember

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:10.790
that Immortal Master had

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:11.920
a very strong

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.030
and distinctive scent of perfume powder.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.720
Yes,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.590
the person who delivered the box

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.590
had a distinctive perfume powder scent.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.070
It was quite unique,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.680
so I remember it clearly.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.240
Is this the scent?

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.430
I was thinking at the time

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.880
that an Immortal Master from the mountain

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.110
should smell of incense.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:35.270
How could they smell of perfume powder?

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.110
Strange.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.930
Do you remember this scent?

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.440
Yes, that's right.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.010
This is exactly the scent.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.400
Both the jade shop owner

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.680
and the Immortal Master
from Qingtai Mountain

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.350
have confirmed this scent.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.510
Miss Huo,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.680
what do you have to say for yourself?

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.720
You call this evidence?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.270
Why would I kill Chu Guangsha?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.720
It's a long story.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.730
Maybe it's connected to Yesha.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:59.310
Xiao Beiming,

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:00.830
are you insane?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.420
Just to crack the case,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.550
you're pinning the crimes of Yesha

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.480
on me?

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.550
Enough talk.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.830
Come back to
the Elite Constabulary Unit with me.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.680
No way.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.320
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.550
Qing Ying.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.160
She knows martial arts?

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.550
She's not the maid you thought you knew.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.160
Qing Ying,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.240
what's going on?

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.880
Since it's come to this,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.110
stop resisting.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.750
When did you

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:13.950
start suspecting me?

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.200
Your disguise was good,

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.830
but there were still a few flaws.

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.070
First, Madam Feng,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.000
a mother who loved her daughter dearly,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.070
would have been

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.070
most reluctant on her deathbed

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.750
to part with her daughter.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.550
But with her

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.830
last breath,

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.290
she looked at you instead,

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.890
and entrusted her daughter to you.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.550
Qing Ying.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.000
Mom.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.790
The lady

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:36.200
is in your hands now.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.640
Please take good care of her.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:40.310
Yes.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.160
My instinct tells me

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.680
this wasn't just a simple request,

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.510
but a demand for your guarantee.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.000
Because her daughter's life

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.510
is in your hands.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.370
There were so many people present,

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.960
yet not one suspected me.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.110
It was such a tiny flaw

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.400
and you still managed to spot it.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.480
That's not all.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.920
Everything we just told Miss Huo

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.070
was true.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.830
However, besides Miss Huo,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.230
there's someone else

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.920
who visits Qingtai Mountain every month.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.880
And this person uses

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.640
the same perfume powder as Miss Huo.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.270
This person

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.720
is the maid who is

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.480
always by her side

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.410
and doesn't arouse any suspicion.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.750
Miss Huo,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.110
does Qing Ying

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.310
also use Beauty Snow?

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.920
We've shared cosmetics since childhood.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.160
People get used to their own scent

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.510
and don't notice the changes.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.110
Miss Huo is currently in mourning

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.960
and doesn't use any perfume powder at all.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960
So this person

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.400
can only be you.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.110
Since you all know already,

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.750
I have nothing more to say.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.830
No!

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.030
Why did you kill Chu Guangsha

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:07.720
and Huo Zongyao?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.270
Because they deserved to die.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.530
Is it because of Haiya?

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.450
You're also an orphan from Haiya?

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.440
That's right.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.350
Everything is proceeding

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.950
according to Master's plan.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.200
But Xiao Beiming...

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.960
When the fish bites the bait,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.680
they won't easily let go.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.350
Continue as planned.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.550
Yes.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.290
What exactly happened

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.550
in Haiya back then?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.580
Do you think I am

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.540
a spineless coward like Zhu Yitie?

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.070
I won't say anything.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.750
Miss Huo,

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.680
don't be too sad,

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.430
Take care of your health.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.680
I never would have thought

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.880
it would be Qing Ying.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.480
She's been by my side

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.400
for so long.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:23.200
At least you're cleared of suspicion now,

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.030
right?

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.240
Did I say something wrong?

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.510
I'm sorry.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.550
How's the interrogation going?

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.280
She refuses to say anything.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.210
It makes sense.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:47.620
They're all people
who aren't afraid to die.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.360
What have you done to her?

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.240
Don't worry,

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:53.310
we haven't handed her

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.160
over to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.920
and we won't

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.180
use any torture on her.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:01.240
But this can't go on forever.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.840
That's why we've come to you.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:08.200
Me?

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.440
But I don't know how to interrogate.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.700
You don't need to know.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.590
Miss Huo,

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:14.520
it's because you know her best.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.440
Also,

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:16.790
you might be

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.590
the person she cares about most.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.480
Constable Tong,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.790
please leave us.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.350
She won't hurt me.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.480
Let me question her.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.310
Be careful then.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.750
Going to cry again?

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.640
I've told you before

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.830
that tears are the most useless things

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.400
in this world.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:14.880
You lied to me

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.960
and to my mother

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.400
just to kill my father.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.160
What is all of this?

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:24.590
Back when you were sold by a trafficker

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.610
and beaten black and blue

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.070
at the entrance of a brothel,

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.600
I was the one who rescued you
from that misery.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.750
Though you were my maid,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.110
my mother and I

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.000
never viewed you as a servant.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.000
I even

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.730
treated you like my own sister.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.640
How could you?

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.720
Why did you do it?

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.400
You didn't save me.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.000
I let you save me.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.070
I chose you.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.110
Don't grab me!

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:05.170
Stop the nonsense.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.750
We give her food and water.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.320
Get in there right now!

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.310
Yeah!

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:19.270
Freeloading off others.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.800
Because you and I are the same.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.150
We're both orphans from Haiya.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.790
Where exactly is Haiya?

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.620
Originally, I entered the Huo Mansion

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.230
to find a chance to tell you

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.800
about your true identity,

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.830
so you could make the right choice,

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.270
just like I did.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.190
But I never expected

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.790
that Madam Feng was always there

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.650
to protect you,

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.140
making you so weak.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.710
I thought

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:08.340
if both your parents left you,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.740
you might become braver.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.750
I never expected

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.350
that you would trust them again.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.710
My mother's death

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.060
was also part of your plan?

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.580
That's right.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.140
That limping physician

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:25.420
was introduced to Madam Feng by me.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.750
In other words,

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.060
I had her put

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.870
the poisonous powder in your father's tea.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.420
And I was the one

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.900
who ordered her to take the blame.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.820
Why would she listen to you?

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.030
It's simple.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:43.440
I just threatened her with your life.

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.060
For your sake,

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.100
she would do anything.

00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:49.820
She didn't flinch even when I made her

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.270
commit suicide by poison that day.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.820
Why on earth

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.860
would you do such evil things

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.030
and be so inhumane?

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.380
I'm not the inhumane one.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.310
It's your father, Chu Guangsha,

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.550
and the Canfeng Army!

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.660
The evil I've done

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:09.660
doesn't amount to a sliver of

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.580
what those people did to Haiya back then.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.190
I only did

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.750
what I had to do.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.140
I only made them pay for their sins.

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:18.840
What's this Canfeng Army?

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.040
What are you talking about?

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:22.790
Never mind.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:25.750
These are the things

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.140
you should know anyway.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.860
All of you, come in.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.620
You hypocrites from the Qi Kingdom,

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.380
listen carefully.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.660
See how fake your so-called justice

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:41.660
and law really are.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.990
Young Master.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.310
I've learned that

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.230
today, Zhong Xueman

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.060
brought people to Guangsha Villa

00:29:58.060 --> 00:29:59.660
and Qingtai Mountain again.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.030
What is she...

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.270
She's investigating

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.400
the murderer who killed Chu Guangsha.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.140
It could also be

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.510
the person who killed General Huo.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.820
Wasn't General Huo's killer

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.950
Madam Feng?

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:12.480
Didn't Zhong Xueman say

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.580
she committed suicide out of guilt?

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.510
What she said
might not be the whole truth.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:18.420
Then...

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.750
I know where to find her.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.550
Follow me.

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.220
What is the Canfeng Army?

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.100
Haiya is on the border of Qi Kingdom.

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:37.480
On the 36th year of Ningtai,

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:38.750
the Qi Kingdom sent

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.790
a military unit called the Canfeng Army

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.060
to garrison Haiya.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.480
Victory is ours!

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.120
Victory is ours!

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.720
[Canfeng Army]

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.000
Great! Great!

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.310
[Canfeng Army]

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.580
But unexpectedly,

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:58.140
as soon as the Canfeng Army
arrived in Haiya,

00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.450
they turned their swords against

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.980
the local Haiya civilians.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:03.690
In a single night,

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.790
all of Haiya was stained red with blood.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.860
The defenseless people of Haiya

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.990
could only beg for mercy under

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.330
[Little Lone City]

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.120
the Canfeng Army's blades.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:16.510
Yet they still couldn't escape

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.750
their tragic fates.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.140
Among them

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.040
were my parents.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:24.060
The Canfeng Army massacred a city?

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:25.790
How could the Qi Kingdom possibly do

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.250
such a thing to civilians?

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.670
You can believe it or not.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.710
If your father and Chu Guangsha

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.040
were still alive today,

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.710
they wouldn't dare

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.110
confront me face to face,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.550
because they were

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.710
members of the Canfeng Army.

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.310
If that's the case,

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:43.710
then the Canfeng Army's massacre

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.970
must have had a reason.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.140
What was it?

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.550
I don't know.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.470
I only know

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.750
the atrocities were committed
by the Canfeng Army!

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.340
Those who advised
the late emperor to massacre the city

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:59.000
were those high officials
from three years ago.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.060
They deserved their deaths.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.860
No matter the reason,

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.470
those who kill

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:06.820
must pay with their lives.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.320
Especially when it was an entire city!

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.190
So I only need to

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.860
follow Master's plan

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.890
to make them pay with their lives.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.760
I don't care about anything else.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.030
Master?

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.900
You mean Yesha?

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.310
Of course.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.660
Zhu Yitie said

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.310
Yesha most likely died three years ago

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.900
at Fengbo Lake.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.950
Who ordered you

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.420
to kill Chu Guangsha

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.790
and Huo Zongyao?

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.160
How could Master possibly die?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.550
Let me tell you.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.620
Master is a god.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.470
He is the faith and light

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.420
for all Haiya survivors.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.030
He will never die.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.310
He will always lead us

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.190
to live on

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:01.510
until the Qi Kingdom

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.060
pays the price it deserves.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.860
Until we avenge

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.900
all the people of Haiya!

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:21.710
Qing Ying!

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.490
[As Boundless As the Sea and Sky]

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:46.190
[As Boundless As the Sea and Sky]

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.470
Stop right there!

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:21.070
The murderer?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.560
Another suicide to escape punishment?

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.550
I'm too late again?

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.030
You've come at just the right time.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.100
This case belongs to
your Secret Investigation Unit,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.700
so you should

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.760
personally take the body back.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.470
Come on.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.840
Where is Zhong Xueman?

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:46.770
Constable Zhong has already left.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.800
Tell her to come see me.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:50.840
Right now!
