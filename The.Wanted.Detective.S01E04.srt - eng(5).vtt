[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.870
[Episode 4]

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.400
Come.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.120
Who is it?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.150
Who dares to interfere with

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.430
an Elite Constabulary Unit investigation?

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.240
Xueman?

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.030
Do you even know

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.090
what you're doing?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.200
Why are you looking at me?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.140
You're a coroner
with the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.150
I'm Feng,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.000
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.130
How come I never saw you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.400
when I was
with the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.000
I joined just over a year ago.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.750
But I've heard of you.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.870
That I'm Yesha?

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.280
Not just that.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.430
You're the one who killed

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.870
Constable Zhong's father.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.310
The Elite Constabulary Unit
ended up like this

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.079
because of you.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.680
Fate is cruel.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.240
Tonight's case in the western outskirts

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.680
is the fourth corpse-sewing case

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.000
in recent times.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.310
You not only didn't report it,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.400
you even burned the body

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.520
to destroy the evidence.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.800
Why did you do that?

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.269
How do you know about

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.920
the previous corpse-sewing cases?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.450
I investigated, of course.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.270
If you don't explain yourself

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.630
regarding these four cases,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.310
I'll report this
to the Ministry of Justice

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.310
and take it straight to His Majesty.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.360
Lately, all major cases in the capital

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.380
have been handled

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.680
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.070
What do you think will happen

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.480
if they take over?

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.159
Chief,

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.810
I really don't know.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.430
The poison inside me—

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.030
were you the one
who gave it to my junior sister?

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:48.159
Yes.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.560
So what?

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.270
You're the number one wanted criminal.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.390
Even if I gave you the wrong medicine

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.680
and poisoned you to death,

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.010
they wouldn't blame me.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.600
I just want to know

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.250
what poison I have in me.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.240
The poison inside you

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.870
is called Blood-freezing Frost.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.200
Blood-freezing Frost?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.000
It was created by my Master.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.870
Once this poison enters your body,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.720
it corrodes your organs and meridians,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.950
causing all your internal energy to vanish

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.210
until your meridians freeze and you die.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.600
I really can't feel

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.130
any internal energy at all.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.560
Little White Dragon.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.600
What Little White Dragon?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.800
Are you talking to me?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.240
You're known as

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.240
the Little White Dragon of Poison Valley.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.750
What?

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.280
Little... little what?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.830
Fine.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.920
Let me tell you a story.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.560
In the martial world, there's an evil sect

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.720
called Poison Valley.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.159
Nine out of ten poisons in the world

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.310
come from there.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.750
The valley was once ruled by two leaders:

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.000
your master, the Unstoppable Old Man,

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.480
and the Old Bug.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.600
But a few years ago,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.630
the Unstoppable Old Man
passed away accidentally,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.720
the Old Bug disappeared without a trace,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.190
and Poison Valley split apart,

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.920
with disciples scattered
across the martial world.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.510
Because of

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.680
their countless crimes,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.720
they are hated by all
and everyone wants them dead.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.980
Do you understand now?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.240
Why are you telling me this?

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.370
Can I take a look

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.190
at the needles you're carrying?

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:28.870
Why should I show them to you

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.830
just because you ask?

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.000
You're Yesha.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.220
I'm here under Constable Zhong's orders

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.480
to keep watch over you.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.350
I woke up a few times while you were

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.680
applying acupuncture for me.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.430
Your acupuncture skills are quite unique.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.380
I've seen them before with disciples

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.510
from Poison Valley.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.270
And those weren't ordinary needles
you were using;

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.000
they were Golden Fire Needles.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.630
In Poison Valley,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.430
the only one skilled with these needles

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.030
is the Valley Master,
the Unstoppable Old Man.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.560
I've heard that the Unstoppable Old Man

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.830
had a disciple

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.530
named Little White Dragon.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.120
If I'm not mistaken,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.830
the needles you're using

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.830
must be your master's.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.500
You hid your real identity

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.040
and blended into
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.800
to escape

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.130
the martial world's manhunt, didn't you?

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.920
Also,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.020
I assume you don't want others

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.240
to know your true identity, right?

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.360
What?

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.240
Trying to threaten me?

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.100
I just want to make a deal with you.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.300
Since you've discovered my identity

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.360
and you've lost
all your martial arts skills,

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.220
killing you would be effortless.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.510
Forget it.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.830
Since you know

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.040
so much inside information,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.190
you must also know

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.510
that those four people

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.400
were killed by Yesha, Xiao Beiming, right?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.080
No matter who the culprit is,

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.360
we shouldn't destroy the body

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.490
to cover up the case.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.450
Then let me ask you,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.360
if I don't destroy the body,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.510
how would this case

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.720
develop?

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:09.310
Yesha's return to the martial world

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.280
will cause panic throughout
the court and beyond.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.240
It's been three years
since the Fengbo Lake case.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.310
The Secret Investigation Unit
has been investigating it

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.720
for three years with nothing
to show for it.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.360
What kind of man is Xiao Beiming?

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.680
What's he capable of?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.640
You, Constable Zhong,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.040
probably know better than anyone else,
right?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.120
Zhuge Tong and his son

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.040
couldn't catch him in three years.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.630
What makes you think we can?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.190
There's another reason

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.510
I destroyed the body—

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.120
you.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:34.909
Me?

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.960
Xiao Beiming was once your husband

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.390
and also the man who killed your father.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.570
Now, he's the most dangerous man

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:41.840
in the world.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.870
I know you've been chasing him

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.840
these past three years.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.510
No one could talk you out of it.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.270
Luckily,

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:50.240
all those sightings in the martial world
turned out to be fakes.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.870
That's why you've stayed safe

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.240
until now.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.240
If you find out now

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.960
that he has reappeared,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.270
with your reckless nature—

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.780
not to mention alerting him too soon—

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.870
can you really guarantee

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.870
you'll walk away alive

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.320
when you face him?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.790
Back then,

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.840
your father showed me great kindness.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.390
No matter what,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.860
I will do everything I can to protect you.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.300
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.120
Chief,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.600
I am a constable.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.750
Even if I have to die

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.350
while investigating cases,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.340
I must live up

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.910
to this uniform I wear

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.480
and

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.150
my father's name.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:05.000
You really do make me curious.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.320
You knew I was a wanted criminal,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.960
but when you saw I was poisoned,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.790
you still desperately tried to save me.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.360
Those pills you gave me

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.630
were precious.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.570
Because I gave you the wrong medicine.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.600
I had to save you.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:22.750
Is that all?

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.060
Though you're a wanted criminal,

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.000
you haven't been sentenced to death yet.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.200
I'm a healer.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.300
You collapsed in front of me,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.900
so of course I would save you.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.750
I'd fight to save you
with everything I've got.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.750
A healer?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.750
That's quite different
from your reputation

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:42.950
in the martial world.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.750
That's a rumor spread by the Old Bug

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.790
to smear me.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.790
He never got along with my master

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.910
and couldn't stand to see me doing well.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:53.840
I haven't harmed

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.280
a single person all these years.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.510
It's so unfair.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.510
Then what kind of person

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.720
are you really?

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.390
As you've seen,

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.030
I didn't even dare to kill a chicken,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.270
let alone a person.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.250
What about the poisons you carry?

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.080
My master once told me

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.880
that poisons come in two types:

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:24.270
those that harm people,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.670
and those that save them.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.480
So you chose the latter?

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.390
What deal do you want to make with me?

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:46.720
Chief.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.790
I've made myself perfectly clear.

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.250
Why can't you understand?

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.600
Even if I let you investigate this case,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.930
can you really solve it?

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.240
If you fail

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.470
and word spreads,

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.790
His Majesty will demand answers.

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:58.960
What are we supposed to do then?

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.790
This time is different.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:00.900
The clues are clear.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.910
I'm confident I can solve it.

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:02.750
What clues?

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.240
In the past,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.630
though his methods varied,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.760
Yesha only targeted court officials.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:08.870
But this time,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.740
the victims were courtesans.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.150
How do you know the victims

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.360
were all courtesans?

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.750
According to Qi Kingdom laws,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.960
criminals have their faces tattooed,
soldiers their arms,

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.630
and courtesans their backs.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.180
The fourth corpse

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.570
had a courtesan tattoo on her back.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:21.850
[Prostitute]

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.720
Constable Zhu said the word "all"
just now,

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.080
which means all four victims

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.390
were courtesans.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:30.870
Jiang Yi.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.590
Did the first three corpses

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.720
all have tattoos

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.520
marking them as courtesans

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.970
before they were burned?

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.790
Yes.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.000
All four women were courtesans.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.320
But when they died,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.390
they were all wearing bridal gowns.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.100
That means

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.090
they had all been redeemed.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.790
So why did Yesha

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.440
target these four women

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.500
of such low status?

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.640
That's why we need to

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.130
start the investigation

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.080
with the victims' identities.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.640
Once we uncover

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.790
the killer's motive

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.840
and his connection to these women,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.220
we can follow the trail

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.640
and surely find him.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720
Once we find him,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.080
the truth will come to light.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.360
Find him?

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.240
Zhong Xueman, what are you doing?

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.770
I just want to find the truth

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.990
and catch the killer.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.040
Chief, please let me do this.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.960
Chief, why don't you

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.080
just agree to her?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.790
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.650
I won't let her cause any trouble.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.310
For the past three years,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.810
you've treated me, the chief,

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.000
like a figurehead.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.870
Oh, Zhong Xueman.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.270
Fine.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.170
You can investigate this case.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.200
Xueman,

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.080
where are you planning to investigate?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.150
As I just said,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.870
we'll start with the identities
of the four victims.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.510
But the bodies are all burned.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.670
One hasn't been burned yet.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:24.470
I'll have someone draw a portrait

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.630
and then take it to the brothels
for investigation.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:27.390
Xueman,

you are a girl after all.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:29.770
Places like brothels

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.270
are better left to us to investigate.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.180
To be honest,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.600
these past 3 years
have been really frustrating.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.000
Mo Chong was transferred to the morgue,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.980

haven't had much casework.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:38.040
I genuinely want

Rest assured.

Once we find any clues,

I'll tell you immediately.

Absolutely not.

Until the truth comes out,

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.550
you're still a suspect.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:45.960
As long as we keep investigating,

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.550
the truth will eventually surface.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.550
Of course I'll keep investigating.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.160
Constable Zhong,

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.960
should I continue staying here?

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:57.510
The dead girl's name was Ruolan.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.000
She used to work at Xingchun House.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.590
A man named Hu Shisan

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.590
sold her there.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:02.720
Hu Shisan?

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.310
Yes.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.000
This man

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.830
is a notorious human trafficker
in the capital.

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:07.000
Not only Xingchun House,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.750
but many courtesans in the capital

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.160
have passed through his hands.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.960
There must be

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.200
something wrong with this man.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.640
Beiming, why do you

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.400
think so?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.310
Look,
human traffickers only deal in selling.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.000
Ruolan was actually bought back

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.920
by Hu Shisan

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.390
half a month ago.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.000
Sold and then redeemed?

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.310
Don't you think that's strange?

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.790
Also, I heard that

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.270
when he redeemed her,

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.310
he gave more money

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.920
than when he sold her.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.460
That is indeed odd.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.270
Where is Hu Shisan now?

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.810
The third courtyard

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.820
at the east end of Sanxing Street.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.680
Stop hitting us.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.480
Please stop.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.030
Your boss is Hu Shisan, right?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.310
Yes, yes.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.550
Where is he now?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.270
Our boss has gone missing.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.480
We don't know where he went.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.940
We're looking for him too.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:02.720
Missing?

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.110
Since when?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.070
For more than 10 days.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.920
We searched

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.720
the entire capital

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.110
but couldn't find him.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.270
Do you know this woman?

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.880
Yes.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.110
She was sold

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.350
to Xingchun House by our boss.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.960
Then he bought her back?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.790
Impossible.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.960
Why would anyone sell someone

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.310
then buy them back?

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.550
Think carefully.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.550
Stop hitting me.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.110
Please, miss,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.960
I'm telling the absolute truth.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:40.920
Where did the women you sold

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.350
come from?

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.270
I honestly don't know.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.830
Every time,

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.270
someone would bring them over by cart.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.110
The boss never said anything,

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.400
and we didn't dare to ask.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.700
The boss makes arrangements

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:51.480
with the brothels.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.640
And we are responsible

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.100
for delivering the women.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.270
Please, miss,

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.000
spare us.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.030
We're just small-time henchmen.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.440
We don't know much.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.790
Tie these two up.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.090
Take me to your boss's room
to have a look.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.000
Okay.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.960
This is

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.030
our boss's room.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.690
We usually don't dare go in.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.790
Please.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.720
A human trafficker actually read books?

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.880
To be honest,

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:31.640
these books are just for show.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.900
We've never seen our boss actually read.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.270
Has anyone come by since then?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.440
No.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.540
Did Hu Shisan disappear at night?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.480
It should have been at night.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.640
We woke up the next morning

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.200
to find our boss missing.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.200
Did anything unusual happen

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200
the night before?

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.200
I recall something strange.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:07.400
The night

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:08.750
before our boss disappeared,

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:09.550
I happened to get up to use the bathroom

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.950
and walked past his room,

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.880
and I saw...

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.310
He was crying?

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.720
I had never

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.120
seen our boss cry before,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.760
so it left a deep impression.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.790
Take those two

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.820
and come with me
to the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.310
[Zhong Mansion]

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.110
Young Master,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.470
why are we here?

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.160
Zhong Xueman's behavior is suspicious.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.690
We're here to investigate.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.190
[Zhong Mansion]

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:58.400
Wait for me outside.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.240
Yes.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.650
What's wrong? You startled me.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.890
There's a thief?

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.700
What kind of thief is dumb enough
to steal from a constable?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:57.550
Come here.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.200
Help me.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.000
Zhuge Kongyun?

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.330
What are you doing here?

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.680
Constable Zhong?

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.160
You're home pretty late.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.440
This rockery of yours is quite nice.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.270
I remember coming here before,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:56.410
but I never noticed

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.400
how beautiful this rockery was.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.880
When did the son of the esteemed
Secret Investigation Unit's chief

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.210
start sneaking around like a petty thief?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.830
You've misunderstood.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.030
I was just passing by.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.000
I heard you were investigating a case

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.070
with burned bodies,

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.940
so I thought I'd drop by

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:10.920
to discuss it with you.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.070
I didn't expect you to be out,

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.720
so I let myself in without thinking.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.480
I'm sorry.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.040
The Secret Investigation Unit always

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.390
handles major cases.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.820
Since when are you interested in

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:20.860
such a minor case?

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.310
It's not the case I'm interested in—

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.830
it's you.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.920
Have you thought about the cooperation

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.200
I proposed last time?

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.350
What's there to think about?

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.630
So you really won't work with me?

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.440
Very well.
I won't trouble you any further.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.070
Farewell.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.720
[Zhong Mansion]

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.780
Young Master, did you find anything?

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.400
Get more people to keep a close eye
on Zhong Xueman.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.070
Yes.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.870
[Zhong Mansion]

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.200
That was close, Constable Zhong.

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.880
He didn't discover us, did he?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.210
I managed to cover it up.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.440
I'm afraid it won't stay covered for long.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.570
Constable Zhong, what have you found?

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.440
In my current state,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.640
poisoned by frost toxin,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.750
maybe we should discuss the case.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.240
I might be able to help.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.590
Yes.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.450
Just look at the state he's in.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.370
Hu Shisan mysteriously disappeared?

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.590
What could make a grown man

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.400
cry like that?

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.000
It must have been

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.350
for a girl.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.410
The time Hu Shisan went missing

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.920
perfectly matches the time

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.110
of the sewing murder case.

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.030
The more I think about it,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:03.000
the more suspicious Hu Shisan seems.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.880
What's suspicious about it?

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.400
Why not just catch him and question him?

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.480
I told you he's missing.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.740
Where can we catch him?

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.150
Then let's investigate
the victims' identities.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.640
Hu Shisan's men said

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.680
only he knows

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.510
where the kidnapped girls

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.640
came from.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.510
Doesn't that mean we've lost our lead

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.110
and can't investigate further?

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.400
There's still something to investigate—

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.720
the victims' bodies.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.680
All the bodies

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.280
are at Baishui River Morgue.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.270
There are four bodies,

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.240
and three of them are already burned.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.830
There's no coroner there now,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.690
and I'm not skilled at autopsies.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.200
I'm skilled.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.290
Although I haven't investigated

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.490
big cases,

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.910
autopsy

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.110
is my specialty.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.960
I'm a coroner, Constable Zhong.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.480
Constable Zhong. I know

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.350
you're worried about my safety.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.680
But don't worry,

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:49.830
I won't cause you

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.750
any trouble.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.960
You're worried I'll run

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:57.370
once both of you leave.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:58.480
Don't worry about that.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.960
He has no internal energy left,

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.440
and he's wearing such heavy chains.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.640
He can't go anywhere.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.880
Constable Zhong,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.090
if you're really worried,

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.160
you can take me with you.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.290
With me by your side,

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.750
you'll feel more at ease.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.720
Who's there?

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.680
Coming.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.750
[Elite Constabulary Unit]
[Mo Chong]

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.720
Xueman?

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.350
Why are you here?

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:24.360
Are you on duty tonight?

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.200
Since I was assigned here,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.480
I've had to make this place my home.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.680
I'm here day and night.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.880
I brought some people
to examine the bodies.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.270
Which room are the bodies

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.200
brought this afternoon in?

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.680
In Room Jin. I'll take you there.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.200
No need.

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.550
I can go by myself.

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:49.050
[Room Jin]

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.350
Coroner Feng.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.750
What is this?

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.240
Let me see.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:15.070
It's gold thread.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.970
How could there be gold thread?

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.270
Check the other three bodies.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:20.800
Alright.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.160
The other three bodies

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.070
are all burned,

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:49.810
but they all have
gold thread on their faces.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.160
Let's go!

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:16.230
Let's go!

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.160
Is anyone there?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.000
Help!

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.110
Help!

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.830
Is anyone there?

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.550
Hurry!

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.310
Fire!

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.240
Get water!

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.350
Bring the large buckets!

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.430
Get water quickly!

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.440
Hurry, get water!

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.240
Coming!

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.000
Hurry!

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:36.640
Get water, quickly!

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.790
Fire!

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.480
Xueman!

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.960
We need more people!

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.550
Why are you here?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.550
And who is this?

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.480
I was about to ask you the same question.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.440
Why are you here?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.010
Chief was leading us on a patrol nearby

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:01.070
when we saw a fire here,

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:01.930
so we came over.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.110
I brought people to examine the bodies

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.680
and almost got burned alive inside.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.340
Since you're on duty tonight,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.200
you can't avoid responsibility

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.400
for this sudden fire.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.600
Who's guarding the door today?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.000
Are you crazy?

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.270
This is a bleeding shoulder injury
from an old wound.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.590
He needs treatment immediately.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.270
Let's go.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.550
Let's go.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:24.830
Zhong Xueman?

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.350
Why are you here?

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:30.790
Now we can't leave.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.070
Stay calm.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.310
I had some new insights

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.510
about the corpse-sewing case,

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:36.720
so I called Coroner Feng

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.650
to the morgue for another autopsy.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.570
Did you find anything?

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.550
We had just entered when the fire started.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.000
He's injured?

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.110
Get him treated quickly.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.110
Thank you, Chief.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.350
Wait.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.920
Who is this?

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.000
Chief...

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.070
He...

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.880
This is...

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.310
Look up and talk.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.440
Sir...

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.880
I... I'm here to help.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.160
What is he saying?

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.830
Chief,

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.350
I invited him here.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.920
We were overwhelmed

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.250
examining four bodies,

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.970
so I asked for his assistance.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.590
Unexpectedly, the fire broke out

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.880
and burned his hand.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.720
So now I want

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.110
to take him for treatment.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.830
See?

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.290
His hand is badly injured.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.280
And his shoulder is wounded too.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.000
Go.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.920
Get him treated.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.680
Hurry up.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.030
Thank you, Chief.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.480
Hang in there.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.540
We'll go put on some ointment for you.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.240
Wait.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.140
Since you were brought here
by Coroner Feng,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.070
you must have some background, right?

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.880
Which government office do you work for?

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.400
Or are you with a morgue?

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.750
How come the Chief and I

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.280
have never seen you before?

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.110
Turn around.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.860
This might be...

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:07.930
I mean him.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.630
Since you're already out here,

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.090
why are you wearing a mask?

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:39.550
I told you

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.230
not to run around

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.110
and you have to listen to Coroner Feng
about everything.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.070
Look at the mess

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:45.280
you've caused.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.190
Could it be you

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.320
who accidentally set the house on fire?

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.920
What are you mumbling about?

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.320
He's from my hometown.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.320
We were speaking our local dialect.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.960
He's new to the capital and knows nothing,

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.590
so I had him stick close

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:59.120
to Coroner Feng to help out.

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.760
I didn't expect

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.420
he would cause such a trouble.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.570
Be more careful next time!

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.840
Chief Fang,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.110
the fire is huge.

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:10.960
What if the Ministry of Justice
asks about this?

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.590
Hurry up and put out the fire!

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.920
Alright.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.030
Yitie,

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.280
prepare the horses.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.550
We need to get to the Ministry of Justice
right away.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.190
Yes.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.320
-Be careful!
-Boss!

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.230
Thank you.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.590
Boss!

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.290
What's the relationship between you two?

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.670
Why should I tell you?

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.970
If you don't tell me,

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.590
don't think you can leave here.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.690
Bring it on!

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.550
Constable Zhong,

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.800
please don't hurt him.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800
He works for me.

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.440
Have you found out

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.280
what I asked you to investigate?

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.190
This plan is too risky.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.320
I don't agree with it.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.880
You'll get yourself killed.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.140
I have no other choice.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.880
Alright.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.480
Go do what you need to do.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:10.320
He works for you?

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.880
Haven't you figured it out yet?

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.920
If my boss hadn't told me

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.110
not to lay a finger on you,

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.970
I would've beaten you up already.

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:16.710
You planted him

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.510
in the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.920
Yes.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.320
He's the one who told me

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.400
the clue to the sewing murder case.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400
How many things

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.590
have you been hiding from me?

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.670
Just this one.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.360
And now you know about it too.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.150
What exactly are you trying to do?

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.190
What are you trying to do?

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:32.320
You still want to fight, don't you?

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.400
Try me if you dare!

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.510
Let's talk this through.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.730
Don't get physical.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.150
Tong Shuang, go outside first.

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.110
Me, go outside?

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:41.920
Boss, if I leave,

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:42.550
what about you?

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.230
I'm fine.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.320
You're injured.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:45.960
I won't die.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.000
But... but these people...

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.280
If you keep making a scene here,

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:49.940
I'll suffer worse than death.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.150
Come on.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.630
Go outside first.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.510
Fine.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:57.510
I'm warning you,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.550
if anything happens

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.190
to my boss,

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.070
I'll fight tooth and nail

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:02.670
to make you pay.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.230
Constable Zhong,

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.760
I placed him
in the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.320
only to investigate
the corpse-sewing case,

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.670
find the Tailor, and catch Yesha.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.630
Nothing else.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.550
The urgent priority now
is to solve the case.

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:14.630
Once it's solved,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.440
the truth will come out.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.630
Right, right.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.830
Let's solve the case.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.510
It's strange though.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.110
As soon as we arrived at Room Jin,

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.040
a fire broke out.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.280
Plus, the door

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.030
was locked from the outside.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:27.510
Do you think

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:28.250
this fire was

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.630
deliberately set for us?

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.430
That's right.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:33.030
The only one who doesn't want us
to examine the bodies

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.030
and investigate the case is the Tailor.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.800
At that time,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.230
I found that gold thread

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.360
under the victim's skin.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.200
It's extremely pure,

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.200
soft as silk,

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.880
and moves with the skin

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.110
without piercing it.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.830
But I don't know its purpose.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.960
The Strange Stories of the Nine States
mentioned

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.190
a rumored secret technique

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.550
called Gold Thread Rejuvenation.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:49.880
By placing hair-thin gold threads

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.480
under a woman's facial skin,

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.670
it keeps her complexion like smooth jade

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.070
and preserves her youth forever.

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:56.190
The gold thread we found is likely

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.760
used for this rejuvenation technique.

00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.920
Gold Thread Rejuvenation?

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.840
That's cruel.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.510
Does Qi Kingdom
have such a secret technique?

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:02.110
Nanyue.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.360
According to
the Strange Stories of the Nine States,

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.420
this is a unique technique in Nanyue.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:07.030
It seems these four victims

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.880
are connected to the people of Nanyue.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.420
Wasn't Nanyue destroyed?

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.280
That's correct.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.630
Then where should we go
to find the answer?

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.160
-Nanren Lane.
-Nanren Lane

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.920
Since the clues point to Nanyue,

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.670
we'll definitely find new leads

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:22.840
in Nanren Lane.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.800
Oh no.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.510
All our evidence

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:26.590
was in the mortuary,

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:28.520
probably already burned to ashes.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.230
Without evidence,

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.810
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:32.320
won't support your investigation.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.850
I don't need their support.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.280
I'll investigate on my own.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:35.920
But...

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:41.760
I'll go with you.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.230
Nanren Lane's situation is uncertain.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.560
Having one more person can't hurt, right?

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.200
You come with us too.

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:49.760
I don't feel comfortable

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.000
leaving you here alone.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.530
What do you mean by
"don't feel comfortable?"

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.770
[Nanren Lane]

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:19.510
Constable Zhong?

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:20.930
are we going to investigate

00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:22.230
every single Nanyue person?

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.840
They are all poor commoners.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.840
How many of them
could afford gold threads?

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.880
There's nothing to investigate.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.070
Let's go take a look at the gold shops.

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.800
We might find some clues there.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.670
Welcome.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.760
What can I help you with?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.930
My steward said

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.960
your gold shop is well known in the area,

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.080
so I brought my wife here

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:54.910
to take a look.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.810
You two are clearly

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:57.890
a perfect match—

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.980
a talented man and a beautiful woman.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.320
You've come to the right place for gold!

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.070
We Nanyue people have

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:07.360
unmatched craftsmanship
when it comes to gold.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.290
Please, take your time and browse.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.650
Sir, ma'am,

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:11.850
how about this piece?

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.190
Here.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:19.190
Is this all?

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.000
Looks pretty ordinary.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:22.630
You've got a sharp eye,

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:23.590
I can tell.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.950
Wait a moment.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.800
I've got a few premium pieces in my shop.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.260
I'll go fetch them for you.

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.550
Please wait here.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.150
No need, sir.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.760
Coming!

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.210
We've already found

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.540
what we're looking for.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.010
We heard that Nanyue people

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.710
are skilled
in the Gold Thread Rejuvenation technique.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:28.320
My wife is beautiful and elegant.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.230
I'd like to ask

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:30.150
if you know anyone

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:31.610
who is skilled in this art.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.320
What?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.620
Gold Thread Rejuvenation?

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.920
I've never heard of it.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:36.840
I don't think

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.740
you'll find what you're looking for

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.620
in my shop.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.480
The gold items here
are all rough and poorly made.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:40.960
You should

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.510
try somewhere else.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960
Really?

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:45.410
I heard that the people of Nanyue

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:46.880
use black gold paper
and a seven-catty hammer

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.080
to make gold threads.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.360
They wrap gold foil with black gold paper,

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:51.320
then hammer it 36,000 times

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.780
with a seven-catty hammer

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.880
to produce the gold threads

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.940
used in the rejuvenation technique.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.260
This is what you use

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.020
to make gold threads, isn't it?

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.200
I didn't understand

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.840
a word you said.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.400
I still have business to do.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:05.920
Please,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.490
this way.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.880
Thank you.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.990
Please leave.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.360
Sir,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.360
I don't think you don't understand—

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.820
you're just afraid of
getting into trouble.

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.760
Wait.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.070
You're forcing me to kick you out,

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:18.800
huh?

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.920
Hurry up and leave!

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.760
Go!

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.190
Ouch! Ouch!

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.590
Coroner Feng, close the door.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.360
Coroner?

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.800
Who are you guys?

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:30.510
The Elite Constabulary Unit
is investigating a case.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:35.920
Who did you sell the gold threads to?

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.480
I...

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.060
I really don't know anything.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.460
If you tell us the truth,

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.510
you might suffer less.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.230
I'm just a businessman.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.960
I haven't broken any laws.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.800
What right do you have to arrest me?

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.210
There have been several serial murders

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.610
in the capital recently.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.650
We suspect the killer

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:52.000
is connected to the gold threads.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.840
What gold threads?

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.400
I really don't know anything.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.110
Chief,

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.640
looks like we have to take him back
to the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.640
for the "pig-skinning" treatment.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.440
What's "pig-skinning?"

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.840
It's a little trick

00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.630
the Elite Constabulary Unit uses

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:04.510
on stubborn prisoners.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.360
They strip them naked,
tie them to an iron bed,

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.400
pour boiling water on them,

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.220
and keep scraping their skin

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.250
with an iron comb.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.760
Some prisoners are so stubborn

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.960
they won't talk
even after their skin and flesh

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.800
are scraped away to the bone.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:17.840
Heat up more water.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.190
This man is pretty tough.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.390
We'll probably be scraping for a while.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.150
Turn up the heat.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.310
I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.710
It's Blossom Skies.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:27.800
What?

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:29.590
I gave the gold threads to Blossom Skies.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.850
What is Blossom Skies?

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:31.800
Blossom Skies

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:33.000
is highly respected in the religion

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.110
of our Nanyue people.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:34.930
It's specifically meant to protect

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:35.970
our people.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.630
The leader of Blossom Skies, Sada,

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.400
is a messenger from Blue Heaven.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.700
I supply these gold threads

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.140
to the chosen saintesses

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:43.190
selected by Sada.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.260
Do you know this woman?

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.510
How do you have a portrait

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.150
of our Saintess?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.550
What exactly do you know?

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.320
This is the Saintess from two months ago.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.550
She has already been taken by Blue Heaven

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:54.800
to protect our Nanyue people.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.280
Two months ago,

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.960
how many saintesses did Blue Heaven take?

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.590
Five.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:59.230
Were they all implanted
with gold threads by you?

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:00.030
Yes, yes.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.710
I implanted them all myself.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.000
I'm telling the truth.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.670
Two months ago,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.600
Blue Heaven took five saintesses,

00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:10.670
but four of them

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.230
were recently sewn and murdered
by the Tailor.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:14.760
In broad daylight,

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:16.910
a holy light descended from the sky.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.660
The saintesses
were taken away with the holy light

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.510
by Blue Heaven.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.150
This is too strange.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.680
Could there really be gods?

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:25.150
I never believed in

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.550
divine manifestations.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.620
Someone must have been faking it.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.510
Otherwise,
how could the kidnapped saintesses

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:33.440
have died such horrible deaths
at the hands of Yesha?

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.550
The gold shop owner said that

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.280
on the 15th day of every even lunar month,

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:37.280
Blossom Skies holds

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.360
a fireworks ritual

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.480
to choose a saintess

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.480
to offer to Blue Heaven.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.360
It's June now, another even month.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.070
The 15th?

00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.110
That's tonight.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.600
Let's go see for ourselves.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.240
Young Master,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.850
Zhong Xueman
has taken people to Nanren Lane.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:07.440
Are our people following them?

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.280
They've been following them all along.
