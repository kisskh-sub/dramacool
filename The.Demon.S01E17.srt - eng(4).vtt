00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.439
Cat Demon?

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.719
It's really you.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.000
Who are you?

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.920
Dayao!

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.879
Where have you been?

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:46.280
I've been looking for you!

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.079
A half-demon?

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.319
If you want a duel, let's just have one.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.239
Cut the crap.

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.599
What a joke.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.200
You've been doing evil for a century.

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.159
And now you're

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.280
doing humanity harm

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.519
with this half-human and half-demon.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.079
You're dead meat!

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.840
A half-demon?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.079
Momo.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.280
I've heard about half-demons.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.199
A half-demon is the result
of a human and a demon's union.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.639
And they're not able
to enhance their spiritual power.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680
Hear me out, Momo.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.400
No matter how hard I work,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.479
petty tricks

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.639
are all I can manage.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.360
Thus...

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.319
It's not that

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.400
you're reluctant
to make me the Guardian.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.240
I just can't be one.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.120
Momo!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.919
You busybody!

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.479
Fan Dayao.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.639
Run.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.120
Step aside!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960
He's my master.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.039
If you want to fight him,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080
defeat me first.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.879
You think I dare not do that?

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.120
Of course you'd dare to do it.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.479
But I think

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.719
you should go find Miss Rong first.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.240
Just you wait.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.520
I've cast the Heartless Spell on you.

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:57.039
Whenever you think of her,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.919
your heart will be in bone-eroding pain.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:02.680
Things won't end well

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.759
if you fall in love with a demon.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.840
Master.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.520
No matter
what her past lifetime was like,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.560
she hasn't hurt the innocent in this one.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.319
What a joke.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.360
A demon is born to hurt people.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.439
But she's not the same.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:20.560
How stubborn you are.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.839
Accept your punishment.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.720
Momo!

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.600
Momo!

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.959
Momo!

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:36.639
She's not back yet.

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.319
Where could she be?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.319
What are you doing here?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:44.759
I'm getting you out of here.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:45.680
Go away!

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.240
Are you really going to stay here

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.079
and witness his wedding?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.560
So what if I am?

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.439
If you're here to catch demons,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.800
just come at me.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.920
I've never thought of capturing you.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.680
Then why did you

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.519
cause a scene at my fort
time and time again?

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.639
Were you messing with me?

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.639
You've changed a lot.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:14.680
What?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.879
You're different now.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.040
I have no time for you.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.279
Enough!

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.120
This place is no longer safe.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.759
My master knows

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.720
you're hiding here.

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:28.079
You should head back
to Qianchun Mountain soon.

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.160
What do you want, Si Ming?

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.160
Don't tell me

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.160
you're trying to help me here.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.560
For one last time.

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:57.240
You're wasting your time here.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.800
I'm leaving with Shen Wangchen.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.839
I love him.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.199
I'm going back to Demon Fort with him.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.439
I think he loves me too,

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.000
so there's no way
I'm leaving him alone.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.199
A human and a demon's union

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:27.759
is destined to be
the cause of all the trouble.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.000
By then,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.079
Shen Wangchen will be

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.959
in deep water,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.240
getting despised and reprimanded
by everyone in the city.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.759
All this has nothing to do with me.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.000
I think

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.759
he's having a hard time here.

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:40.759
I don't want him to be sad.

Here comes the auspicious hour.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.079
First bow to Heaven, Earth,
and the Divine Shrine.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:46.360
Shen Wangchen.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.039
Are you really going to marry her?

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.440
Yes.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:12.720
Fine.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.399
After the wedding,

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:18.360
you'll return to Demon Fort
and be my consort.

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.000
Don't you get it, Fan Dayao?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.000
With what you have,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.970
you're never going to become formidable
and lead the Demon Fort.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:31.759
Stop kidding yourself.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.200
They've bowed down to you

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:34.759
simply because

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:36.360
they're not able to put up a fight.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.159
In reality,

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:37.919
they've been making use

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:38.600
of your foolishness

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.000
and toying with you like some puppet!

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.759
Without the most basic

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:43.399
common sense,

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:43.840
how can you

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.080
gain a foothold in this world?

00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.679
Listen here.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.100
Since the moment

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.320
I stepped foot in the Demon Fort,
it had been an elaborate plan of mine.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.960
I did what I did

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.360
to use you

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:54.120
and eradicate the Demon Fort.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.960
Now you know it.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.399
Be it a human or a demon,

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:58.879
no one is trustworthy

00:09:58.879 --> 00:09:59.960
or reliable.

believe in yourself!

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:03.679
And now

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.519
you love me, do you?

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.480
