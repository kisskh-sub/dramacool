00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:07.025
(Moyuan City)

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.640
Come here!

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.840
Don't move!

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.840
Stop!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.359
Come here!

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.120
Stop right there!

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.159
Hey, I'm talking to you!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.640
Stay still!

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.840
Come here!

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.120
Yes, you!

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.760
Look carefully.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.120
Get over here!

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.000
Behave!

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.760
Who says you can leave?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.480
Come here!

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:45.079
Look carefully!

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:45.920
Don't let my parents know

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.480
about the Cat Demon

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.400
when we arrive home.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.719
Yes, Young Master.

00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:58.825
(Shen Residence)

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.439
Young Master,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.599
you've finally returned.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.000
(Zhen Gui)
City Lord's health is...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.799
Mr. Zhen,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.920
take me to my father first.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.640
Young Master, come.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.400
This way, please.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.325
(Shen Residence)

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.599
Here.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.240
Dear, take this medicine.

00:02:19.162 --> 00:02:20.680
(City Lord of Moyuan City)

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.599
That's enough for now.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.479
City Lord!

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.319
Madam!

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.639
Young Master has returned!

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:28.240
Chen!

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:30.560
Chen.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.639
Mother.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.360
Father.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.560
I have returned.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.360
Chen,

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.080
I am so glad to finally see you.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.560
(Lady of Mo Yuan City)
They said

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.479
you were caught by a Tiger Demon

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.800
in Qianchun Mountain.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.039
I thought...

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.120
Forgive me for making you worried.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.560
I'm just glad you're back.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.599
As long as you're safe at home.

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.919
Young Lord,
there's something you don't know.

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.599
While you were away,

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.479
demons kept appearing in the city.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.319
The people here

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.960
would rather kill a hundred by mistake

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.599
than miss one.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.840
Moyuan City

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.120
is in chaos,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.400
making everyone on edge.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.599
City Lord has been working day
and night,

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.199
which has worsened his old illness.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.680
And your health is also...

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.479
Enough!

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.800
Chen just returned.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800
No need to say more.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.120
Yes, Master.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.719
Father,

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.599
I've been unfilial.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.479
I couldn't care for you
while you were sick,

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.479
and I couldn't share

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.960
the burden of the nation with you.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.639
Chen, get up.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680
You're not to blame.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.639
So tell me.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.280
Did your trip
to the Western Regions go smoothly?

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.840
Chen,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.080
did you find the medicine

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.039
to cure your strange illness?

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.199
Don't worry, Mother.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.240
We have a lead.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.479
That's great.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.520
Zhen Gui,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.120
go to Qianchun Mountain

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.639
and retrieve that medicine immediately.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.960
Mother, shouldn't we wait
until things are certain

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.080
before sending someone?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.159
Why wait?

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.560
Bring the medicine back.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.000
Once your illness is cured,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.439
your marriage arrangements
will be easier.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:56.479
When that time comes,

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.120
I want to hold grandchildren
in my arms someday.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.879
But Mother...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.800
Then...

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.599
City Lord,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.039
Princess Huaiyang sent an invitation.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:07.970
She wants to invite Young Master

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.360
to have lunch
at Xiaguang Restaurant the next day.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.080
Princess Huaiyang?

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.479
It's something absurd.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.120
Last year on Chinese New Year's Eve,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.879
Princess Huaiyang came to Moyuan City

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.720
with officials
to hear the people's concerns.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.279
She saw you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.480
and...

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.519
She fell for you at first sight

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.800
and hasn't forgotten you since.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.000
Not long after,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.519
she personally came to find you.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.839
Luckily,

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:37.120
you were here
because you were away looking

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.160
for medicine at the time.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.360
It was absurd.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.279
We told her

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.639
about your illness

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.720
to decline politely.

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.800
Do you know what she said?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.639
She said you're handsome

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.720
and that seeing you every day
would make her happy.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.439
What kind

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.399
of nonsense is that?

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.759
Princess Huaiyang

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.480
is extremely headstrong.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.079
She's definitely not a suitable match.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.279
Don't worry.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.879
I'll go see her.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.040
Those are my rabbits!

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.360
Give it back!

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:24.319
What if they are rabbit spirits?

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.279
No! Don't!

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:26.759
Don't kill my rabbits!

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.800
It's not a demon.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.360
You're the demons.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.720
Get away!

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.639
You demon!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So it's you!

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.319
No!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.600
You...

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.800
How dare you get in the way
of a demon slayer?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.160
Stop it,
or I'll report you to the authorities.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.399
You?

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.480
You can't even identify demons,

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.680
and you want to catch them?

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.879
The strongest demon

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.360
is right in front of you.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.600
Yet, you're picking

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.879
a fight

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.959
with three kits?

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.800
Who are you insulting?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.480
It seems like

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.519
you came to compete for the bounty.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.639
Prepare to die!

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:24.480
What a trash.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.920
A demon!

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.120
The demon has killed someone!

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.120
Demon!

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.560
That's right.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.639
I am the strongest demon

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.519
in the world,

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:36.560
Fan Dayao.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.120
Go and tell your family.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.079
Yes, it is I,

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:39.839
Fan Dayao.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:41.720
The strongest demon in the world!

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.959
Pleased to meet you.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.920
Pleased to meet you.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.800
We should leave.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.480
Go home.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.120
Let's go.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.662
(Bai)

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.000
Why aren't you running?

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.439
Aren't you afraid I'll tear you apart?

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:54.319
Dayao,

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.800
I think you're so cool!

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.360
I really like you.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.480
You like me?

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.199
Thank you for saving my rabbits.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.720
Aren't you afraid of me?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.160
No,

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:07.480
I like you.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.879
(Like me?)

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:10.639
(This kid)

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.439
(somehow reminds me)

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:12.839
(of Shen Wangchen.)

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.920
(Maybe she's Shen Wangchen's ally.)

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:16.759
Tell me!

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.879
Where's Shen Wangchen?

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.879
Dayao,

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.439
we're going home for lunch.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.240
See you again.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.639
Humans, huh?

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:32.000
If it keeps raining,

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:34.120
I won't last much longer.

00:07:52.937 --> 00:07:56.262
(Princess Huaiyang)

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:14.680
I've heard you have a strange illness.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.839
But your complexion and appearance

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.240
are flawless.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.680
Your Highness, you flatter me.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.680
We do make

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:27.480
a fine pair.

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.959
Don't you think so, City Lord?

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.000
Thank you for your praise,
Princess Huaiyang.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.279
Now that the Young Lord has returned,

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.320
pack your things,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.559
come back to the capital with me,
and tell my parents...

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.159
Your Highness,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.720
I already have someone I love.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:50.480
Who?

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:51.720
A princess?

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:52.720
A royal princess?

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.600
Or…

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.639
To you, Princess,

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.799
she's only an ordinary person.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.159
To me,

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:58.679
there's no one like her.

00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:02.960
I ask you to be magnanimous.

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:04.960
Shen Wangchen!

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.159
Those who caught my eye

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:08.320
have no right to refuse me!

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.639
Someone!

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.440
Yes, Your Highness.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:11.759
Take him back.

00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:13.080
No.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.840
Absolutely not.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.039
Dear,

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:15.799
calm down.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:18.120
They are all royal guards.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.000
If a fight breaks out,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.679
it would offend the Emperor
and bring trouble

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.919
to everyone in Moyuan City.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.000
They can't get near Chen.

00:09:25.279 --> 00:09:26.679
He knows what he's doing.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.840
Where's that wretched Shen Wangchen

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.000
hiding?

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.720
With all this southern rain,

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.120
I'm glad I moved to the northwest.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:40.399
I have to be careful.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.039
I can't turn into a cat again.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.519
This mission is serious.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:43.960
Everyone, come!

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.960
Look at this.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.879
What is it?

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.159
Let me see.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:48.559
Let me see.

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:49.799
Why is there a crowd?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.080
Could Shen Wangchen be there?

00:09:52.559 --> 00:09:53.360
All right, then.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:54.759
For the demon core,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.039
I'll give it my all.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.625
(Xiaoyao Inn)

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:14.600
(Xiaoyao Inn)

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:15.879
Look! Look!

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.480
Stop looking.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.120
The City Lord's son

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.039
is marrying the Princess.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.240
A perfect match.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:24.320
You see.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.000
The Young Lord and the Princess

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.360
are a pair of talent and beauty.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360
They're absolutely perfect together.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.679
Yes, it's quite the celebration.

00:10:29.679 --> 00:10:31.600
Young Lord? Is it Shen Wangchen?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080
I can go with you.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.320
But don't drag my family into this.
