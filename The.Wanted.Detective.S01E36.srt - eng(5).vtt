[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.700
[Episode 36]

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:40.509
Hurry up.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.120
This is the place.

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.370
We've been here before.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.229
This is where the goods shop

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.640
delivered the Bosuo Flowers.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
There's nothing left inside.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.020
This is just the entrance.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.690
The entrance?

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.060
There's a hidden chamber inside,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.260
and a secret passage.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:01.870
In this house,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.890
there's a hole behind the closet.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:04.560
That hole

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.080
is dug deep and wide.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.520
The entrance is right here,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.400
and the exit

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.410
is over there,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.810
in that courtyard by Fengbo Lake

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.120
where there are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.030
three willow trees.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.950
Three trees?

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.610
You mean the courtyard

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.070
next to Dingfeng Pavilion?

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.710
So it's near Dingfeng Pavilion,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.079
hidden right under our noses?

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.000
At that time,
we were wanted throughout the city.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.870
While searching for Miao Yun,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.120
we hid in Dingfeng Pavilion.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.280
At that time, Chief Zhuge

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.280
protected us

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.940
by avoiding this area

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.900
during his patrols.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.030
So up to now,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.090
this place has never been inspected.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.470
For wanted criminals,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.520
this is the safest place

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.079
in the entire capital.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.000
Darn it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.760
I can't believe we've been helping him.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.680
Li Long.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.630
Take some men and surround

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.800
from the courtyard outside Fengbo Lake.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.030
We'll go in from the inside,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.020
and we'll attack from both sides.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.960
We must catch him.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.430
Yes.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.370
Let's go. Hurry up.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.400
Come on.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.960
Let's go.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.310
Master.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680
I have failed you.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.970
In the end, I wasn't able to kill

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.030
that Taoist Yunji.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.540
This place

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.680
is about to be exposed.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.480
We should retreat immediately.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.710
It's too late.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.910
They should be

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.470
standing right

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.890
above us now.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.520
The exit by Fengbo Lake

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.190
must have also been surrounded.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.870
Master.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.680
You leave first,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.710
and I'll hold them off.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.190
You take them and leave first.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.120
Absolutely not!

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.150
If you stay here

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.240
and something happens,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.560
that'll...

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.630
Don't worry.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.910
Everything is going as I planned.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.840
Thank you, Taoist Yunji.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.750
It's dangerous here.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.910
You should leave first.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.800
Thank you all for saving my life.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.120
If you successfully capture Yesha,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.430
I won't charge a penny

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.520
and will perform for three days straight

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.120
to celebrate your success.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.710
Deal.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.690
Thanks a lot.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.519
Everyone, be careful.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.270
You're here.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.120
Stay alert.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.840
You said we would meet again,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.210
and I wouldn't dare miss our appointment.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.400
It seems I've underestimated you.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.290
You have nowhere to escape now.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.909
Hand over the Swift Wind Pill

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.040
and come back with us.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.870
Go back?

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.159
Where to?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.070
The Elite Constabulary Unit
or the Heavenly Prison?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.510
Too bad I've been to both.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.560
There was nothing you could do to me.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.980
You just had to watch me

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.250
walk away, didn't you?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.510
We've seen through your tricks.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.720
Do you think

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.520
we'd fall for them again?

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.310
Then guess,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.950
why would I let Taoist Yunji

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.920
see this place,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.630
and why would I be here

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.680
waiting for you?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.600
Right.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.360
I did say I underestimated you,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.560
but I never said

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.950
you could win.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.870
Do it!

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.120
You guys

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.750
are such a nuisance.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.600
I'll let you out

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.730
once I'm done with what I need to do.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.800
When the time comes,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.720
I'll let you see with your own eyes

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.500
that everything you try to protect

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.180
will cease to exist,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.710
and the entire Qi Kingdom

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.690
will be completely transformed.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.870
Bastard!

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.480
I remember when we first came in,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.150
I felt many currents of air

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.159
blowing from different directions.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.159
This underground secret passage

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.560
must be interconnected,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.010
with more than one exit.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.800
That is to say

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.750
our men above

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.290
have no chance of capturing him at all.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.070
All our men from
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.830
and the Secret Investigation Unit

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.070
are focused on this place,

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.040
which in turn gave them

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.800
the opportunity to commit their crime.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.659
We've all fallen into their trap!

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.040
Check out these bricks.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.200
These are bricks
fired in an official kiln.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.270
This place was probably not

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.390
dug out by them,

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.750
but was originally part

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.830
of the Qi Kingdom.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.950
This is an abandoned underground waterway.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.070
The underground waterways
of the Qi Kingdom

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.870
were built very spacious

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.950
for flood discharge,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.240
even navigable by boat.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.570
With Gong Fu by his side,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.750
he can now easily control
the entire underground waterway system

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.190
of the Qi Kingdom.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.430
He just said

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.430
he'd destroy everything

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.159
we try to protect.

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:37.360
His final plan

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.630
is probably to use
the underground waterways

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.870
to infect the entire population
of the Qi Kingdom

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.070
with the pill poison.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.810
That's impossible.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.680
He can't possibly

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.800
execute such a plan.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.430
Although the capital

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.750
is filled with underground waterways,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.510
the drinking water channels
are separate from each other,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.070
and the wells

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.480
between different streets

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.950
are also not connected.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.190
I understand now.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.430
It is exactly to prevent

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.000
someone from poisoning the water

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.460
and contaminating the entire water supply.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.630
If he wants to poison

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.000
the entire population,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.240
he would need to connect

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.870
all the drinking water channels
of every street.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.600
That would require
enormous manpower and resources.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.460
He can't possibly accomplish it.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.000
Do you still remember

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.870
the customs of
the Heaven Worship Ceremony?

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:19.870
What's with that?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.040
The palace never uses well water
for drinking.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.390
The water His Majesty drinks

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.240
is all sourced from

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.170
the Imperial Spring in the palace.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.430
That water is sweet,

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.810
and after each Heaven Worship Ceremony,

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.730
His Majesty

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.250
would bestow this sweet dew to the people,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.710
which is giving the water
from the Imperial Spring

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.840
to the common folks.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.480
I remember it now.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.200
There's a shallow well

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.840
on every main street in the capital

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.200
called the Blessing Well.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.080
But those wells are normally dry.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.000
Only after each
annual Heaven Worship Ceremony

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.080
does sweet spring water appear in them.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.630
At that time, all the citizens

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.750
bring their bowls

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.600
to drink a bowl of
this so-called sweet dew.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.150
These wells

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.240
are specially built water channels

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.080
that all lead back to the Imperial Spring.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.440
If Yesha poisons the Imperial Spring

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.790
through the underground waterways,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.480

They're traveling by water,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.600

Let's find a way out first.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.240
The mechanism's connection points
are the weakest.

Are you alright?

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.790
This won't do.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.000

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.600

for the Swift Wind Pill.

Xueman...

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.650
I know
the Swift Wind Pill is highly toxic,

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.840
but before the poison takes effect,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.270
it gives ordinary people

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.080
several times

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.650

break this place open.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.510

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.750
Master!

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.510
But he didn't have time

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.400
to tell others how to use it.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.030
That's why the Blood-freezing Frost

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.090
has always been considered a poison.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.270
I didn't lose.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.030
I didn't lose to you.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.310
I clearly won.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.460
You did indeed beat me,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.400
but you also truly lost.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:24.720
Justice prevails,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.680
and righteousness endures.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.200
You lost to the righteous spirit

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.510
of countless people
over these past 20 years.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.240
No.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.550
I understand now.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.640
It's fate.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.200
It's heaven.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.000
It's the heavenly way
that won't let me win!

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.920
Even now,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.510
it still favors you!

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.160
You once asked me

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.200
if you joined the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.440
and I joined the Pingyuan Escort Agency,

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.750
what would become of you

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.280
and what would become of me.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.040
I didn't answer you then,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.400
but I can give you

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.240
my answer now.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.680
If that were the case,

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.720
you might have become

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.550
a better Beiming,

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.200
but I

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.880
would never have become

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.000
a more wicked Bei Kun.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.440
What makes you so sure?

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.200
Because in this world,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.400
there will always be suffering,

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.030
and there will always be

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.720
people who are not favored by fate.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.110
But suffering and hatred cannot be

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.440
reasons to harm the innocent.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.240
Even if such suffering

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.400
had befallen me,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.980
I still firmly believe

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:26.830
that if

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.890
Miao Jie had appeared before me then,

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:29.750
I would never have done

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.830
what you did.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.000
That's because you don't know

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.400
where your roots lie!

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.200
But I do.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.880
As someone from Haiya,

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.960
I did nothing wrong

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.310
seeking revenge for Haiya!

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.310
But what about those Haiya orphans?

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:42.680

They weren't all living in hardship.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.680
Some could even have lived peaceful lives,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.750
yet because of you,

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.250
they all died tragically.

which one of them

has lived a better life because of you?

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.240
You keep saying

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.000
you were doing it for Haiya,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.510
but when have you

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.640
truly cared about Haiya in your heart?

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.400
You feel pain from your past misfortunes,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.800
and because of that pain,

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.030
you demand that others

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.360
suffer just as you have.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.030
Because of your selfish desires,

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.090
you've caused countless tragedies.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.270
How is the evil you've inflicted
on the Qi Kingdom

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:20.110
any different from

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:21.160
what the Qi Kingdom

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.420
did to Haiya back then?

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.080
Today you seek revenge against
the Qi Kingdom,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.680
but who'll bear the Qi Kingdom's hatred

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.000
in the future?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.030
Actually, you've had many chances

to turn back.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.790
The moment I left with Miao Jie,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:44.510
I knew

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:45.550
there would be

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.880
no chance for me

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.510
to ever turn back in this life.

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.110
Back in the underground waterway,

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.270
when Xueman and I were trying to escape,

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.470
we found explosives all over the walls.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.790
You could have easily

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:57.990
blown us all to death,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.850
but instead, you merely

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.710
trapped us inside the mechanism.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.640
I just wanted you all

to witness the fall of the Qi Kingdom
with your own eyes.

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.000
But I lost.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.440
we'll reunite here.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.310
After all, we still have

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.440
an important matter

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.500
that requires everyone's presence.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:31.370
[One year later]

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:34.330
Who would have thought

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:35.960
that Constable Xiao would hold

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.110
another wedding after four years?

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.070
Indeed.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.070
Mr. Zhuge

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.190
is already Chief now,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.449
yet he's still the one leading the horse.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.560
Have some candy.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.630
Back then,

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.280
I was the one who led your horse,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.480
and now it's me again.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:55.070
But now, I'm the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.550
I really lost face this time.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.280
How should I face people from now on?

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.150
That can't be helped.
You lost to me again last night.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.840
Besides,

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.110
why are you dressed up

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.150
so flashy again?

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.320
Never mind.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.590
The greatest detective of the Qi Kingdom

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:09.320
marrying the same person twice

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.760
and me leading the horse twice

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.030
must be unprecedented

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.150
and will never happen again.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:14.590
I'm truly honored.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.200
Next time, I'll lead the horse for you.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:43.920
Seeing you get married,

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:45.510
I've finally

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.150
put one worry to rest.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.070
When I reunite with your mother

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.230
in the afterlife,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.770
we'll both be able to rest in peace.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:36.280
