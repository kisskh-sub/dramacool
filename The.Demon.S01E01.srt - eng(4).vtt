00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:08.159
Why are demons called demons

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.959
and not humans?

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.680
It's like a beam of light shining into the darkness.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.879
Then the light itself is deemed guilty.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.480
Once, demons appeared in the world.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.159
But human fear

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.840
gave rise to demon catchers.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.359
By order of the Moyuan City Lord,

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:27.319
they hunt down demons.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.879
Surrender now!

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:29.560
I'll stay.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.480
Let the children go.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.760
In the name of catching demons,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200
they harm innocent lives.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.879
This sparks conflict between humans and demons.

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.719
The City Lord's son

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.640
has suffered from a strange illness since childhood.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.400
No one can approach him.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.719
Because of this,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.560
he set out for the Western Regions.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.439
Rumor has it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.719
only the cat demon of the West

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:57.480
can cure his affliction.

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:59.200
There,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.959
demons run rampant.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.159
It's full of mysteries.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.560
Brothers,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.800
we've had a fruitful day.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.879
Let's slaughter a few beasts soon

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.520
so everyone can celebrate.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.199
Alright.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.159
The tiger demon is here!

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.479
Release the animals first.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.800
Please spare us, Your Majesty!

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.199
Young master, let's go quickly!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.639
Stop, all of you!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.159
Are you seeking death?

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.439
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.000
He's just an ordinary human.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.479
How does he have such power?

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.639
That's impossible.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.159
Your Majesty, this man is strange.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.319
We shouldn't prolong the fight.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.519
Shen Gongzi's strange illness

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.160
Only the Western cat demon

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.879
can give you shining eyes and let you touch the light of the world

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:07.680
She

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.079
This person is extremely dangerous

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:21.920
Must not be released

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.480
Or there will be endless trouble

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.160
Go, hurry!

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.360
Who said you could leave?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.480
Stop wasting time and energy

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.439
You can't beat me

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.319
Let them go

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.079
If you want to let them go

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.600
That's fine

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.720
You have to come back to the demon village with me

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.480
If you refuse

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:47.120
I'll kill everyone within a hundred miles

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.360
Everyone

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.639
Shen Gongzi, we don't want to die

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.439
You have to save us

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.560
Save me, save me

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.920
She can make me see colors

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.920
but she's just a wicked tiger demon

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.160
Better to play along and decide later

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.759
Fan Dayao, I hope you'll keep your word

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.959
If I stay in the village

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:14.079
I won't harm the innocent anymore

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.240
Welcome back, Chief!

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480
Welcome back, Chief!

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.720
Welcome back, Chief!

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.759
Welcome back, Chief!

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.519
Listen up, everyone

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.079
From today on

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.279
We must treat Shen Gongzi well

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.680
Yes, ma'am

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.160
Treat him well

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.839
Shen Gongzi

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:16.360
Are we really staying here?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.040
Shen Gongzi

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.600
I know you want to protect

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.319
those people

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.120
But if we

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.279
still can't find that cat demon

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.000
and don't get rid of her soon

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.120
I'm afraid your body

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.680
won't make it through this winter

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.079
We're really out of time

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.079
Besides

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:34.319
we're living here now

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:37.639
I can see colors now

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.279
Colors

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.319
Shen Gongzi can see colors now

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:49.680
Jiang Li

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.199
Shen Gongzi

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.759
You can see colors now

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.079
How come

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:57.800
your strange illness that

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.199
makes people fly away

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.519
still isn't cured?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:03.879
Come

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:10.680
Shen Gongzi

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:15.800
Wait, that's not right, Shen Gongzi

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.800
How can you see colors now?

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.959
Maybe it's related to Fan Dayao

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:20.879
Fan Dayao

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.399
Could she be

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:24.480
the demon you're looking for?

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.480
No, that's not right

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.360
Shang Shibei said your illness

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.879
was caused by a cat demon

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.399
But Fan Dayao is

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:31.959
a famous tiger demon

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.039
Then we have to find the answer from that tiger demon

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.039
and get the answer

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.200
Si Ming

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.799
We've known each other for years

00:08:58.039 --> 00:08:59.120
Why are you still making trouble?

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.919
You bold tiger demon

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.600
How dare you harm people in the city

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:10.279
Ridiculous

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.440
When humans harm us

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:14.320
why don't you stand up for justice?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.720
Do you have some obsession with demons?

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.080
All demons in this world

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:25.240
should be slain by my Star Sword

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.200
Trying to run?

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.639
Prepare to die!

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:15.080
Darn it, it's raining

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.639
Who's there?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.120
What's going on?

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.399
And who are you?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720
Why did you hurt my cat?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.120
Sorry, I made a mistake

00:11:01.159 --> 00:11:02.440
Why is he here?

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:04.080
You're hurt

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.159
Let me take you back first

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:08.720
Alright

00:11:16.879 --> 00:11:17.679
Darn it

00:11:18.039 --> 00:11:19.679
Are we just going to let him do as he pleases?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.399
I really have no strength to resist now.

00:11:28.399 --> 00:11:29.679
None at all.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:32.559
Gongzi,

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.639
How can you still be in the mood to keep a cat?

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.600
I'm so anxious I could die.

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.480
How can you—

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.279
What are you looking at? You think I want this?

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.320
Gongzi,

00:11:42.679 --> 00:11:43.360
Why don't you—

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.480
team up with that demon hunter

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.879
to deal with Fan Dayao?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.120
We could come up with

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.360
a plan to coordinate from inside and outside.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.120
And wipe out Aowu Village in one go.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.840
I heard you.

00:11:57.919 --> 00:11:59.360
Then Gongzi, get some rest.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:00.759
I'll head back first.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.120
Wipe out Aowu Village?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.120
Don't even think about it.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.519
Kitty,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.639
I saved your life.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.080
Shouldn't you repay me?

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:14.399
He really did save my life.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.240
I came to this place,

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.600
not knowing anyone or anything.

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.519
Meeting you

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.200
is probably fate.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.000
If you hadn't practiced dark arts,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.320
I would've torn you apart right away.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.399
You wouldn't even be alive here

00:12:25.399 --> 00:12:26.679
talking to me about fate.

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:32.519
What are you doing? Hey!

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.080
Where are you touching? You—

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.679
This is for

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:36.080
acupoints that promote wound healing.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.080
Let me press them for you.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.759
Don't touch me, I'm the king!

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.120
Where's my dignity as king?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.039
Where's my pride?

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:41.600
I'm warning you—

00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:46.360
Actually, this feels pretty good.
