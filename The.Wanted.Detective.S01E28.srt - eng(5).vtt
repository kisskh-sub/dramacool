[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.780
[Episode 28]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.950
I really didn't expect

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.070
to encounter man-eating monsters here.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.270
Let me put it this way.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.039
If we had run slower,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.039
you wouldn't have seen us again.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.920
I have an idea.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.509
Just to be on the safe side,

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.200
let's take turns keeping watch tonight.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.460
Don't put out the fire.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.789
Okay.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.280
I'll take the first shift tonight.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.870
Okay.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:22.680
I can't believe

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.280
such creatures truly exist.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.329
Don't be afraid.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470
There is no such thing
as ghosts or monsters.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.600
That creature is...

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:29.600
probably a species

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600
we've never seen.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.560
I'm not afraid.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.890
Pretend to be asleep.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.710
Why is it a child?

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.200
Follow up to check it out!

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.400
What's this stuff?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.530
Where did you get it?

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.370
How come they're all women?

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.430
You're not Haiya people.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.490
Where are you from?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.750
There are survivors indeed.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.120
We're from the Qi Kingdom.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.190
Can we have a word?

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.880
Go away!

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.750
We mean no harm.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.950
Go away now!

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.550
Let's go.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300
Even though we've found survivors,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.600
they all seem savage.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.510
Yeah.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.390
They wouldn't hesitate
to launch fatal strikes.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.020
Beiming,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.830
let's just raid their campsite.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.070
We're investigators,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.100
not bandits.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.159
Why attempt a raid?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.750
But they have our luggage now.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.420
Besides,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.150
Madman's medical chest

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.310
was taken too.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.220
Did you deliberately tell them

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.620
we're from the Qi Kingdom

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.390
just to see

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.390
how they'd react?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.460
Yes.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.660
Evidently, they do know

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.220
what exactly happened

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.280
in Haiya years ago.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.390
This is

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.460
good news for us.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.980
But they're very hostile

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.020
toward us.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.460
How should we...

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.260
It's okay.
Let's resume the discussion tomorrow.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.300
Beiming.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:33.540
Why do we have to

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.740
prepare so much food?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.630
This will be

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.100
our ticket in.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.510
Those we saw on the campsite yesterday

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.020
all seemed feeble and weak.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.420
That kid had the nerve to sneak in

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.480
and steal our food.

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.420
Also, I noticed that the people

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.280
on that campsite were all female.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.710
Given that, I suspect

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.430
all the men there already...

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.310
I got it.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.659
The food can buy

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.150
our way into their place.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.980
After all,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.870
people are the most fragile

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.980
when they're hungry.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.660
Right?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.720
They're having a hard time now.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.520
We...

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.920
should help them,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.870
no matter what.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:19.830
Those monsters have appeared

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.070
more and more frequently lately.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.510
We've been hiding here the entire time.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.440
Our food supplies are running low.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.660
I'm afraid we can't sustain ourselves
for too much longer.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.750
Still no word from Dasong and the guys?

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.410
They've gone for over a month.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.600
I'm afraid they're already...

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.950
Luo Shu!

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.460
Luo Shu!

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.930
Those from the Qi Kingdom
we met last night

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.130
have come here again.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.210
Let's go.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.590
How dare you come back? What do you want?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.630
Do you have a death wish or what?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.580
Miss, please calm down.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:53.680
Look carefully.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.220
We're not carrying any weapons.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.880
We've brought you something.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.100
What exactly do you want?

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.980
We've notice that you seem

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.100
to have starved for a long time,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.220
so we decided to bring you food.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.870
That's right.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.220
We can have a nice chat.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:11.870
Take your things back!

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.070
Stop pretending to be compassionate,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.270
you Qi people!

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.460
Step back!

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:18.570
Get out of here!

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.580
Okay!

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.070
We'll step back.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.980
I'll leave these things on the ground.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.580
Beiming...

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.220
It's okay.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.290
Come get them yourselves!

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.960
Place the food here.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.040
We're leaving now!

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.420
Let's go.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.770
How do we deal with those things?

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.420
Qi people would never be that kind.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.220
I bet something must be wrong

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.020
with what they brought us.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.750
But...

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.310
that is food.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.710
Where is your pride?

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.900
I have children at home.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.340
They've been hungry for days.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.340
I must do something

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.540
before they starve to death!

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.420
Enough. Stop bickering.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.830
Bring those things in.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.710
Test if they're poisoned.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.970
Distribute them if they're proven safe.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.850
We offered them so much food,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.150
yet

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.580
they shot arrows at you.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.310
We're unable to

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:25.770
soothe their resentment.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.630
I just hope they would realize

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.710
that we mean well.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.460
Besides,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.120
at least that arrow today

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.450
was aimed at the ground,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.919
not at us.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.480
But, Beiming,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.059
now the problem is

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.140
our supplies are running low,

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.090
since we've given them

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.020
much of our food.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.870
Only these Haiya people

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.570
can help us

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.830
find out what really happened years ago.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.100
Let's go pluck some fruits.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.180
Fine.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.430
Does everyone have a portion now?

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.450
You should eat something too.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.380
I'm not used to this kind of food.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.580
Keep it for yourself.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.090
Are you going out?

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.500
We got food from those Qi people,

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.760
but it won't last long.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.540
I must go to that place.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:19.300
But it's too dangerous there.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.580
Won't we be left in the lurch

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.110
if anything happens to you?

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.810
I'm going there alone this time.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.470
If I can't come back in 15 days,

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.420
you and the others must leave here.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.240
Staying put will only
get yourselves killed.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.120
Luo Shu...

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.060
Keep yourself safe.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.780
Xing?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.610
Why are you out again?

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.420
Go back now.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.970
You're not allowed to follow me.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.060
This place is dangerous.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.730
Go back now.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:41.380
What's wrong?

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.450
Xing!

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.380
Xing!

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.950
Go check it out.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.540
Xing, Xing!

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.420
Back off!

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.660
There's poison in him.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.210
Touch him,

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.300
and I'll kill you!

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.330
He's a physician.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.730
He's here to save the boy.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.300
He was bitten by a viper.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.060
My medical chest...

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.210
There's first-aid medicine in it.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:38.340
My medical chest...

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.140
They stole it.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.470
It is now on Haiya people's campsite.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.260
Make way.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.140
Let's take him to the campsite.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.850
Hold on!

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.330
You can't go there.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.780
We don't have time to hear you

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.900
talking about the feuds between Qi people

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.500
and Haiya people now.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.570
If you are to save the boy's life,

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.700
you must do as we say.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.140
Let's go.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.900
Hurry.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:02.780
Open the gate.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.380
But they're from the Qi Kingdom.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.500
I told you to open the gate.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.960
Xing was bitten by a viper!

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.260
Open up now!

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.210
Be quick!

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.090
Go fetch my medical chest.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.210
I didn't take it.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.140
I don't know where it is.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:24.180
It's a black chest

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:24.850
with a little white dragon on it.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.730
Look for it!

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.500
Go!

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.060
Make it quick!

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:27.730
Everyone, search for it!

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.390
Make sure you find that chest!

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.920
The venom is getting to his heart.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.100
We can't delay the treatment anymore.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.300
My medical chest... Where is it?

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.570
Found it!

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.370
Bring it here!

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.140
Give it to me.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:43.450
The chest...

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.110
Put it here.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.810
Hand me my acupuncture kit.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.800
-Xing.
-Xing.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:09.500
Xing!

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:11.820
Thank God!

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.500
Though you're from the Qi Kingdom,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.290
we Haiya people

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:26.660
can tell you're nice and kind.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.120
Thank you for saving Xing.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.970
Also, thank you for saving Luo Shu,

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.540
and for the food you sent us,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.620
which has saved many of our people.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.730
Don't mention it.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.090
It was just a small favor.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.020
I'd also like to thank you

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.350
for putting trust in us.

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:40.850
I'll persuade the others

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.450
to let you stay here for the night.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.020
You may leave tomorrow morning.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.180
Okay. Thanks.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.500
I have a question...

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.300
Why do Haiya people

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:50.060
harbor enormous hatred

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:51.320
toward the Qi Kingdom?

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.190
I also have a question.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.170
The Qi Kingdom has enforced
a blockade on Haiya.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.500
There is no way in or out.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.090
How did you get reach this place?

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.420
What's the purpose of your visit to Haiya?

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:04.810
An elder

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.970
gave me a map.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.060
We came to Haiya

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:07.930
for an investigation

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.730
on the Haiya Case.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.660
Investigation?

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:12.660
Don't you know

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.780
what your own kingdom did?

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.440
Is your visit even necessary?

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:17.970
The Haiya Case is

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.180
classified in the Qi Kingdom.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:20.830
That is why

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.020
we had to make this visit.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.820
It should really be classified.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.540
After all, how can the Qi Kingdom

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.180
reveal its own unconscionable

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.910
and inhuman acts to the public?

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.380
I'm done talking.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.070
Get some rest now, you lot.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:40.980
Didn't get an answer?

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.390
She still has doubts about us.

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.150
Why not let me give it a try?

00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:59.710
If you're here to ask me about

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.780
the history
between the Qi Kingdom and Haiya,

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.240
I have nothing to tell you.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.280
Try not to ruin

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.230
the good impression you left on me.

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.380
Miss Luo,

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.680
I don't know

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.120
what's on your mind,

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.210
but I can tell

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.470
that everyone here counts on you.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.430
To put myself in your shoes,

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.550
though we're both women,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.950
I'm afraid I can't do

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.640
what you're doing here—

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.110
shouldering all the responsibilities.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.780
Outsiders such as ourselves

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.190
can hardly imagine

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.660
the hardships you've been through.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.110
What is it that you're trying to say?

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.900
Above all,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.230
we only want to help you.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.500
Help us?

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:38.070
If it weren't for the Qi Kingdom,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.710
we wouldn't be in the current situation.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.710
All the misery and suffering

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.500
imposed on us

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.190
are attributed to your kingdom.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.850
But you're offering help now.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.010
Doesn't it sound ridiculous?

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.710
I'm a citizen of the Qi Kingdom,

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.740
but I'm actually from Haiya.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.740
You're from Haiya?

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.350
Not just me.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.190
That young man, Mr. Xiao, is

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.460
also from Haiya.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:04.690
How is that possible?

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:05.880
I'm not lying to you.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.270
We were born in Haiya.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.740
But because of what happened years ago,

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.470
we were taken to the Qi Kingdom.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.830
Also because of those happenings,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.910
our families were torn apart.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.140
So, we can actually feel

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.310
the pain and grief

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.900
you've experienced.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.880
The purpose of our visit

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.880
is to find out what truly happened.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.860
When the truth is out,

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.350
perhaps we'll be able to
diffuse the tension

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.210
between the Qi Kingdom and Haiya.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.550
Suppose you're telling the truth,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:52.810
what can you and your little group

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.220
do to help?

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.920
But we have to try first, right?

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.110
We're just like you.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.740
You've been taking care of your fellows.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.550
I believe you've never
thought of quitting,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.310
despite all the difficulties.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.940
Similarly, there are tasks

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.550
we must complete.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.980
So, I implore you to trust us.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.349
We would never harm

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:13.380
our own people.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:19.000
Xiaoyue,

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.630
bring in some water.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.910
Sit down and talk.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.599
Okay.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:29.780
Thank you.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.680
Answer my question.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.600
Haiya is a forbidden topic
in the Qi Kingdom.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:36.660
How did you find out

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.390
you're originally from Haiya?

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:40.900
We learned

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.310
that the Qi army committed a massacre.

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.420
Then, from an orphan registry,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.830
we found out about our origins.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.510
But we don't know why the Qi Kingdom

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.750
would do that kind of crime.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.860
This is the reason we...

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.110
You don't know the cause.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.380
Neither do we.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.560
You don't know that either?

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.060
Luo Shu is telling the truth.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.310
Back then, we lived

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:02.350
in a mountain village bordering Haiya.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.080
The Qi army didn't discover us,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.060
so we luckily escaped death.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.700
Being little kids at that time,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.190
we didn't know anything,

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.500
except for the fact

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.180
that from then on,

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:14.750
we started being

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.990
surrounded by many, many monsters.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.380
Didn't the adults tell you

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.550
what was going on?

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.220
All they told us was

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.510
that the Qi Kingdom slaughtered

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:25.510
our people,

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.880
that the Qi Kingdom
introduced those monsters to our land,

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.340
and that the Qi Kingdom
destroyed our homes.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.790
In fact, even they didn't know

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.380
how all of that happened.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.430
A catastrophe just befell.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.150
Haven't you thought of
figuring out the truth?

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.860
Over these years,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:42.550
we've been

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.310
in a living hell,

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.950
hiding from place to place.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.180
We've helplessly watched our beloved ones

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.350
die of cold, starvation,

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.080
and the monsters' attacks.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.140
Every day when we wake up from sleep,

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:55.620
all we can think of is

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.480
how to survive.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.420
Find out the truth?

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.590
How?

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.420
What can we do even if we know the truth?

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.020
What can we possibly change?

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.750
We're nothing but a cloud of ants

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.590
that haven't been crushed.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.940
We're not that capable.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:16.990
We have told you

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:18.660
everything we know.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.420
Sorry.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.070
On this matter,

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.310
we can't be of much help.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.910
I understand.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.510
Thank you both for being honest with me.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.590
Did you

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:45.550
hear any noise?

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.380
Is it the wind outside?

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:51.940
I think it's Xiaoyue.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:52.550
Let's go!

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.270
She's not beyond cure.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.370
Did wild beasts get in here?

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.060
She was bitten by a human,

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.750
rather than a beast.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.560
How could it be a human?

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.660
Miss Xiaoyue,

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.860
what just happened?

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.830
I don't know.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.110
I simply came out to light the lanterns.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.590
When there was light,

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.070
I looked down

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.140
and found her here.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.620
Miss Huo,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.040
get me my medical chest.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.470
Okay.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.380
Beiming.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.110
There are bloodstains on the eave,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.840
extending all the way outward.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.790
Xueman,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:44.510
gather everyone

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.310
on the campsite.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.460
Tong Shuang, let's go check it out.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.220
Wait!

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.180
There are many wild animals outside.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.110
Maybe you should give up the chase.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.900
Don't worry.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.270
Where?

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.940
Here.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.550
Beiming, over there.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.110
Let's go.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.970
The blood trail ends here.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.840
It's hard to conduct a search
in this vast forest.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.700
Let's go.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.760
I smell blood.

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.540
Tong Shuang.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:42.900
It's still warm.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:44.570
Like the what happened on the campsite,

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.730
it was bitten and killed by a human.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.140
What kind of monster could that be?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.160
This person had the guts

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.490
to eat such a scary hare.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.150
Watch out.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.590
There might be beasts nearby.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.660
How is that girl doing?

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.160
She was revived.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.970
Thank you.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.400
What exactly happened tonight?

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.790
As you know,

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.970
monsters appear quite often here.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.880
They break in sometimes.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:50.550
That monster

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.640
didn't just break in, right?

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.070
What do you mean?

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.230
I don't understand.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.460
Do you not understand,

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.720
or are you concealing something?

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.380
At that time, Feng Qingzhuo said...

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.780
She was bitten by a human,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.790
rather than a beast.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.490
Your reaction upon hearing

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.850
a human bitting another human seemed odd.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.700
I guess

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.220
the same thing had happened before, right?

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.080
I examined the footprints nearby

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:22.590
and found that monster

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.140
didn't come from outside.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.430
Instead, he seemed to be here
the entire time.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.380
Miss Luo,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.380
I don't know if our meaning

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.510
has got across to you,

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.030
or if you would trust us.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.380
But the monster we're facing now

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.440
is very dangerous.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:38.750
There's no way you and your fellows

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:40.410
can take him down yourselves.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.460
If you don't want anyone around you

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.720
to get in danger again,

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.220
then please trust us.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.660
Fine.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.360
I'll take you to a place.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.240
Why is there a smell of corpses?

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.510
Aren't you wondering

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.830
about that monster?

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.680
Come down here with me.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.760
Hand me that torch.

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.110
Be careful.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.060
I'll examine the bodies.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.550
No need.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.270
They all starved to death.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.440
Starved to death?

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.040
How come?

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:45.750
Were they

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.970
your enemies?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.220
They were our family members.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.140
Why would you lock your family members

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.100
in cages and let them starve to death?

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.300
Have you gone insane?

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.670
We're not insane.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.560
They were.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.900
Didn't you see

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.070
that monster?

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:05.750
Actually,

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.940
that is my brother, Luo Sen.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.350
This is the cage

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.510
he was kept in.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.950
How did all that happen?

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.550
Years ago,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.030
the Qi army

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:22.690
committed a massacre in a town

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.660
in the center of Haiya,

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.070
which we called

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.830
the Lonely Town.

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.980
After the Qi army's atrocities,

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.980
the Lonely Town

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.890
became the most mysterious

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.580
and dangerous place in Haiya.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.270
It's said that all visitors to that town

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.220
would end up losing their souls to demons

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.250
and turning into monsters.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:46.590
The supplies on the campsite

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.660
were not enough to sustain us

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:48.790
through the winter.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.640
In order to survive,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.260
my older brother

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.180
and the other men on the campsite

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.870
decided to take a risky trip
to the Lonely Town.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.860
It was once a prosperous town after all.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.320
All those horror stories about that town

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.180
didn't seem as daunting

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.030
as the threat of death.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.660
Any supplies we could get from there

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.250
meant a higher chance of survival for us.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.420
They successfully

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.150
returned from the Lonely Town.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.180
They brought sufficient supplies back

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.310
to support us through the cold winter.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.790
However, little did we know

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.790
that it was the start of a nightmare.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.420
Those who visited the Lonely Town

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.580
went insane one after another.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.940
Just like the rumor had it,

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.800
they lost their souls

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.600
and humanity,

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.310
ending up being monsters.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.380
Every time after they went rogue,

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.620
they would pass out.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.820
But once they woke up,
they'd be violent again.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.700
No one knew

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.310
how they became like that.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.900
We had no other choice.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.510
So, my brother decided to

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:53.110
lock these people up

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.380
in this secret dungeon

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.890
when they were unconscious,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.090
keeping them out of contact with anyone

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.380
till these people

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:02.980
who had turned into monsters

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.070
starved to death.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.900
My brother

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.760
was the last one to turn.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:13.690
Sen,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.550
maybe this is unnecessary.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:16.700
You seem fine to me.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.280
I know my own condition.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.220
You must take good care of

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.660
the elderly and the children.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.420
Sen, don't do this.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.510
You are fine.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.140
Let's go.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.140
Sen!

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:26.460
Sen!

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.110
Leave here now.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.700
Sen!

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:29.140
Leave!

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.380
Sen!

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:29.790
Leave!

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:30.110
Sen!

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:33.590
Sen!

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:34.510
Sen!

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.510
Sen!

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:39.510
Sen!

00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:41.220
Sen...

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:42.510
Sen... Sen...

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.620
Sen...

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.510
Sen is my only family.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:56.590
I can't just sit back

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:57.750
and watch him die.

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.270
So, after everyone

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.460
falls asleep,

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.900
I'd secretly thrown him some food.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.100
But when I visited him tonight,

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.220
I found that he had broken the chains

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.790
and fled from his cage.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.030
I panicked

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.260
and chased after him,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.160
but it was too late.

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.140
My brother...

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.700
already mauled a girl.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.690
What's done cannot be undone.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.410
We must figure out a way

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.880
to find your brother now.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.340
Do you have any ideas?

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.770
My brother is a huge menace now.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:28.070
However prominent the problem is,

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.330
we must try solving it.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:30.590
Never have we believed

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.200
any of that supernatural nonsense.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.620
Your brother
might've changed like you said,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.080
but I'm sure there's a cause for it.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.150
As long as we find the cause,

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:38.810
we'll come up with a solution.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:55.510
Don't you find

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.380
Luo Sen's behavior tonight

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.530
familiar?

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:03.620
It did seem familiar.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.340
According to
what you and Tong Shuang described,

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.490
Luo Sen's crazy acts were identical

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.020
to Old Bug's before he died.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.350
Look.

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.350
His heart

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.680
is swollen and deformed

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.310
just like Old Bug's.

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.030
Old Bug gained immense strength

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.030
after taking

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.050
a mysterious pill

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.320
he cooked for Yesha.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.300
Those Haiya men

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:29.740
turned into monsters

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.520
after their visit to the Lonely Town.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.870
All their hearts

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:34.130
swelled in the same way.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.620
They also exhibited
a similar pattern of behavior.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.660
There wasn't a tie

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.700
between these two groups of people.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.510
How did they end up the same?

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.510
It really puzzles me.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.350
Could it be possible that the supplies

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.620
Haiya people found

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.510
in the Lonely Town
contained Yesha's pills,

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.350
and that they ate them by mistake?

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.180
Who would take an unknown pill?

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.380
Besides, the making of such pills

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.350
was not finished by Huang Wuchang
until recently.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.790
Those Haiya people turned

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.920
at a different time.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.940
If what Luo Shu said is true,

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.590
the cause of those people's illness

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.250
should lie in the Lonely Town.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.260
We still need to find Luo Sen.

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.030
If we manage to
bring him back to his senses,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.130
maybe we'll find some clues

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.030
from him.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.790
After all, among us,

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.350
only he has been to the Lonely Town.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.590
But Luo Sen is still delirious now.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:17.590
We can't just search

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:19.150
the entire forest for him, can we?

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.380
Even if we're lucky enough

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:21.270
to find him,

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:22.350
he might go berserk

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.410
and hurt us, right?

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.900
Beiming,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.660
don't keep us in suspense.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.180
Do you have a finding?

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:31.590
After Luo Sen escaped from the dungeon,

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.650
he bit a girl first,

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.180
and then ate meat in the forest.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.630
It means he is very hungry.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.460
But since he's not really a beast,

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:38.650
we can set up a trap

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.130
and wait for him to emerge.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.380
Where is he? Is he coming here or not?

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.670
The chicken is going to be overcooked.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:08.070
Be patient.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.550
Wipe that drool off your face.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.170
Not after you wipe yours.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.450
There he is.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.620
That's impossible.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:03.550
I put in enough drug

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:04.940
to knock out two bulls.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.590
How did he manage to stand up?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:11.940
Be careful.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:12.560
Don't worry.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:12.910
Okay.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.420
Monster!

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.320
Come help me!
