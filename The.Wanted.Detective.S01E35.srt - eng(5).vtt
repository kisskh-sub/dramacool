[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.780
[Episode 35]

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.509
Where are we going?

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.509
Chessboard Alley.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:42.570
Chessboard Alley?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.509
I remember that's where

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.229
the families
of Ministry of Works officials live.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:45.950
That's right.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.640
Chessboard Alley

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.950
is just a nickname the locals use.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.280
The people from the Ministry of Works
are so set in their ways

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.170
that not only did they build their houses

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.930
exactly the same,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:51.430
[Qiluo Pavilion]

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.000
but also lined them up perfectly straight,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.950
nineteen rows across and lengthwise,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.009
like a chessboard.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.120
But why are we there

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.120
instead of going
to the Ministry of Justice

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.430
to investigate the case?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.200
Because some things

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.480
the Ministry of Justice can't handle,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.140
but the Ministry of Works can.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.510
So who exactly are we looking for?

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.200
Feng Bamao,

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.510
a clerk at the Ministry of Works.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.640
I dealt with him

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.840
before the Fengbo Lake case.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.639
He's just a clerk.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.690
How can he help us?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.890
Of course he can.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.960
Because the work he does

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.360
is different from most people's.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.630
What kind of work does he do?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.150
Under the Ministry of Works,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.710
there's a small office
called the Office of Rodents and Insects.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.400
They handle

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.560
every snake, insect, rat,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.960
and ant problem in the capital.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.030
Most people

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.280
don't want the job,

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.960
but Feng Bamao is different.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.030
He loves this work,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.240
spending his days with bugs.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.680
No one in the world
can match him in this field.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.000
Spending his days with bugs?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.870
So strange?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.930
Strange indeed.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.750
But finding the right person
is what matters.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.490
So the place we're going

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.560
is full of bugs.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
No wonder Zhuge Kongyun

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.280
and Dairong didn't come.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.610
Kongyun is a neat freak.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.280
Huo Dairong was probably terrified

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.030
the last time in the underground tomb.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.360
The one who got bitten was me.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.750
If I'd known,
I would've brought some insect repellent.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.280
Let's go.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.630
Stand still!

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.750
Lift your foot! Lift your foot!

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:14.350
Lift it up.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.280
Lift it.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.360
Easy.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.470
Easy.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.520
You can step on me if you want,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.960
just don't step on it.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.240
What are you looking for?

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.800
A very rare black silkworm

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.660
from the Kingdom of Mulberry.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.710
-How about we help you find it?
-Don't move!

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.190
Get up.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.630
Its skin changes color,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.470
blending perfectly

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.800
with its surroundings.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.840
It's extremely sneaky.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.500
Don't move.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.000
If it gets stepped on,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.040
who knows when

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.320
I'll find another one.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.910
Just stand still for now.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.570
Don't move.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.280
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.200
Don't move.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.070
It's afraid of strong light.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.220
It must be in this room.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.740
But it also hates the dark,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.970
so it won't go into that dark chamber.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.810
It has to still be in this room.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.750
Why are you laughing?

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.630
Didn't you say

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.159
when faced with a difficult problem,

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:55.190
you should use your brain?

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.980
So use it.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.310
My little treasure,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.800
you're getting sneakier and sneakier.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.680
In the future, tie a red thread

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.720
around its head.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.720
It can change color,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.920
but the thread won't.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.350
That way, if it runs out again,

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.550
it'll be easy to spot.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.650
Makes sense.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.920
But using silk spun by its own kind

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.600
to tie it up…

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.870
isn't that a bit…

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.800
Xiao?

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.510
How come it's you?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.920
Long time no see, Feng.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.270
I came this time

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.470
to ask you for a favor.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.240
You just helped me

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.070
with such a big favor.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.360
If there's anything I can do,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.360
just say the word.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.010
I found this

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.270
at three crime scenes.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.120
Their bodies

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.580
were arranged in a spiral.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.070
You're an expert in this field,

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.670
so I'd like you to take a look.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.920
These ants

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.600
are all showing signs of molting,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.240
which indicates
they were extremely agitated

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.560
before death.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.160
Extremely agitated?

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.920
That means extremely excited.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.190
To put it bluntly,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.870
they literally excited themselves
to death.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.830
Excited to death?

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.760
I'm telling you,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.680
I'm a doctor.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.410
Don't try to fool me.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.880
You can heal people,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.510
but can you heal insects?

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.830
People can die from excitement,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.040
so can insects.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.010
These insects

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.680
must have come into contact with something

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.000
before death to end up like this.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.830
You mean…

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.290
they were poisoned?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.560
You're sharp.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.800
Someone must have been using

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.310
certain substances while these insects

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.040
happened to be present,

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.800
causing their deaths as collateral damage.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.130
What kind of substance?

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.360
I don't know.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.270
It definitely

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.510
wasn't a pesticide.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.260
I only specialize in

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.150
insecticides.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.270
Alright.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.240
This trip was a waste of time.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.800
We didn't find any clues.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.360
Sir, you speak so bluntly.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.560
Do you look down on me?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.430
Feng, please don't take offense.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.670
He's not good with words.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:15.600
Just ignore him.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.410
I may not know

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.190
the exact poison
that killed these insects,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.160
but I feel like I've seen bugs

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.050
die the same way somewhere before.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.040
Where?

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.990
My brain isn't working well.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.190
I can't remember right now.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.780
Are you messing with me?

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.290
Don't rush.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.800
See this inner room?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.070
It has specimens of all kinds of insects.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.480
For each one, there's a record

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.680
of how it died,
what its death looked like,

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.600
and where it died.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.480
Let me

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.720
go in and check.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.750
Thank you.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.800
There are quite a lot of specimens.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.430
Can anyone help me?

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.070
Coroner Feng.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.240
Me?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.160
Yes, yes.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.600
Go.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.750
You already know how to heal people.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.480
If you learn to heal insects too,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.480
you'll reach the pinnacle of medicine.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:21.830
I...

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.950
Doctor,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.430
would you help me?

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.680
I'm telling you,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.160
insect bodies

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.800
are far more interesting
than human bodies.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.200
What are you doing?

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:41.480
I have a few poisonous insects inside.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.320
They will attack my face.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.280
What about me?

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.410
You'll be fine.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.370
The one they hate...

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.000
is me.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.070
You'll reach the pinnacle of medicine.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.670
How did you get to know this person?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.750
Once, a palace in the capital collapsed,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.680
causing deaths.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.270
The Ministry of Justice thought
the Ministry of Works officials

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.200
had cut corners,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.100
so they arrested the supervisor.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.480
I was there at the time
and sensed something was off.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.150
Later, Feng Bamao approached me,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.860
wanting to investigate together.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.790
Isn't he from
the Office of Rodents and Insects?

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.790
What does he have to do

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.670
with a palace accident?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.910
He believed the collapse

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.570
was caused by termite damage,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.480
which was later confirmed.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.500
He seems to be quite selfless.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.960
Not only that,

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.000
the supervisor

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.480
had previously had conflicts with him,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.150
yet instead of taking advantage,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.550
he helped uncover the truth

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.720
and cleared his name.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.850
On this point alone,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.320
he seems reliable.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.000
We have a lead.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.200
It's Yunji Palace.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.550
I once saw

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.440
identical dead insects there.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.630
Yunji Palace?

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:05.890
Isn't that

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.550
where Taoist Yunji lives?

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:09.640
Who is Taoist Yunji?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.600
He's a sorcerer from a foreign land,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.670
skilled in all kinds of magic tricks,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.000
especially illusions.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.010
During festivals,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.140
nobles in the capital

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.740
would invite him to perform.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.630
I even invited you to watch once.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.320
I remember.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.620
I couldn't go

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.440
because of official duties.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.600
That's a shame.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.080
One year at the Mid-Autumn Festival,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.080
he was invited into the palace

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.840
and performed a trick

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.510
called "Thousand Miles Landscape"

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.840
in front of His Majesty
and all the officials.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.240
He stood alone on the stage,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240
and with a wave of his hand,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.080
a vision of "Thousand Miles Landscape"

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.670
appeared.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.200
Rivers, lakes, towering mountains,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.600
the sun, moon, and stars—

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.600
all amidst swirling clouds and mist,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.240
accompanied by faint Buddhist chants.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.000
It was truly magnificent,

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.080
absolutely breathtaking.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.080
It seems that

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:51.630
Taoist Yunji's

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.150
"Thousand Miles Landscape" trick

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.600
bears some resemblance to Yesha's

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.130
"Demonized Four Symbols".

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:57.910
If they're

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.630
the same kind of tricks,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.360
then finding Taoist Yunji

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.280
could help us solve our mystery.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:04.200
Thanks.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.650
You're welcome.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.390
So this is Yunji Palace?

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.460
He's just a mechanical sorcerer.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.660
Do you really think he lives in a palace?

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.000
That's right.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.440
Why are you here?

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.440
For trivial matters like finding bugs,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.390
you're fine.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.300
Catching people is my specialty.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.010
Maybe there are bugs in there too.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.480
Alright.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.510
Enough joking.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.970
Let's go in and take a look.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.000
No one's here.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.270
Judging by the dust,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.510
it's been some days.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.030
There are clear signs of a struggle.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.780
He didn't leave on his own;

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.960
he was taken.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.080
It must have been Yesha.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.550
He took Taoist Yunji

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.700
probably to use

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.860
his illusion skills

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.960
to stage
the Case of the Demonized Four Symbols.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.840
So we're late again?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.080
He could take him,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.200
but not necessarily

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.080
everything.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:05.910
Let's split up

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:06.570
and see if we can find any clues.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.480
[Unpredictable Changes]

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.270
I'll search outside.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:08.790
Okay.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.120
Look.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.930
There are dead insects.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.750
Two locks?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.170
Perfect chance.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.440
Let's have a competition

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.370
to see who can pick the lock faster.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.440
Stop it.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.300
It must be tung oil in this barrel.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.340
This is probably what we're looking for.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.360
What is this thing?

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:31.320
I know now.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.240
What?

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.630
Bosuo Flower.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.320
There are scattered petals

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.600
of Bosuo Flowers all over the yard,

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.120
though the blooms have been picked.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.360
But I still found

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.690
their seeds in the soil.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:43.960
Bosuo Flower?

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.510
I've never

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.980
heard of them before.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.360
Have you?

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.670
Then why aren't you surprised?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.530
You're so calm.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:53.550
I'm used to it.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.200
He often talks about things

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.360
that are hard to understand.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.320
Quickly, explain—

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.150
what are Bosuo Flowers?

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.360
Bosuo Flowers
are plants from foreign lands.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.550
According to Yin-Yang Book,

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.910
if you grind and refine

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.750
their flowers and seeds into powder,

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.150
it can become a medicine.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.180
What medicine?

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.600
A sedative.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.530
It's non-toxic.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.510
When inhaled by humans,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.000
it causes dullness of consciousness

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.270
and numbing of the five senses.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.160
The numbness

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.150
doesn't last long,

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.440
so it's hard to detect.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.200
But if insects come into contact with it,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.480
they die instantly.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.150
I'm now certain

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.910
that there was a large amount
of Bosuo Flower pollen

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.980
at the crime scene.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.120
This is the key to the illusion technique.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.480
The Bosuo Flower pollen

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.430
is only an aid to make viewers

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:33.530
more immersed

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.600
in the illusion.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.480
That's right.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.360
By itself,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.960
it cannot create illusions.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.670
Let's take all these things back

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.810
and see if we can find

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.890
anything crucial.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.000
Bosuo Flowers appeared

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.460
at all three crime scenes.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.360
But if you wanted everyone present

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.290
to experience dull consciousness

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.440
and numbed senses,

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.360
the few at Yunji Palace

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.910
wouldn't be nearly enough.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.630
Qi Kingdom
doesn't grow this kind of plant.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.390
If a large quantity
of Bosuo Flowers is needed,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.510
they must be transported
from the Western Regions.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:03.370
In the capital,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.670
the trading houses Xilaigui and Liluxi

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.480
specialize in goods

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.840
from the West.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.150
I'll check and see

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.630
if I can trace the source

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.850
and find some clues.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.270
Such things

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.790
might also be sold at the Ghost Market.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.920
We can go look there.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.360
Okay.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.000
Then I'll stay here with Coroner Feng

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.440
to continue investigating
the secrets of this illusion technique.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.510
Let's split up.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.080
Be careful.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.390
I don't know.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:35.820
[Talc] [Soda Ash] [Alum][Fragrant Bone]

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.530
[Tung Oil]

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.310
[Lime] [Charcoal Powder]

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.640
[Talc] [Green vitriol] [Fragrant Bone]

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.120
I'll talk!

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.960
I'll tell you everything!

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.840
Jiuxiao powder.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.270
The owners of the two trading houses
confessed.

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:54.790
Someone recently purchased
a large quantity

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.690
of Bosuo Flowers from them

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.820
at a very high price.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.790
Who was it?

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.550
Did they see the person?

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.470
The buyer is extremely cautious

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.720
and has never shown their face.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.060
Their method of payment

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.720
is like that
of a traveling theater troupe.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.530
A box of gold and silver

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.960
suddenly appeared in front of the shop.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.680
As the saying goes, "Men die for wealth,

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.810
birds die for food."

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:13.960
Though they sensed

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.030
something suspicious,

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.030
the lure of great profit
was enough for them to take the risk.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.589
At first, they were unwilling to speak,

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.589
probably because

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:20.589
they feared being implicated

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:21.619
in other cases.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.810
So how did the transaction take place?

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.069
With so many flowers,

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:26.470
how did they manage them?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.540
There was an instruction in the box

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.400
telling them to deliver the flowers

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.960
to a courtyard in the north of the city.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.790
Did you check it out?

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.430
Of course.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.480
But we were still a step too late.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.200
By the time Li Long and Fang Yin arrived,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.050
the courtyard

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.140
was empty,

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.110
leaving only

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.510
a few Bosuo Flower leaves.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.000
This only proves
that the trading house owners

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.880
weren't lying.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.250
It seems he had already prepared for this.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.570
The clues we have now

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.400
are too few.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.790
I'm afraid it will get even harder

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:49.920
to investigate later.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.780
I actually managed to find some

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.980
useful information.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.000
You found leads at the Ghost Market?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.530
Although

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.160
there's no seller of Bosuo Flowers there,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.440
we found that recently

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.440
someone transported a large quantity
of Bosuo Flowers

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.570
to the Ghost Market.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.830
Why did they transport them
to the Ghost Market?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.880
It's probably to refine them into powder.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.750
I see.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.150
Refining Bosuo Flower powder
isn't difficult.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:07.780
But refining

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.060
such a large amount of it

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.270
isn't easy.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.270
If it were done openly,

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.110
the unique effects of the Bosuo Flower

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.070
would attract

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.720
many insects during the process,

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.550
making it easy

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.510
for us to notice.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:20.680
That's why

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.310
they placed a large amount
of Bosuo Flower powder

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.880
in the pharmacies in the Ghost Market.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.640
Exactly.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.790
The pharmacies in the Ghost Market

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.880
are meant for refining

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.240
forbidden and highly toxic substances.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.920
They strictly follow
the Ghost Market rules—

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.930
never asking about the source

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:31.720
or the purpose.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.080
So, sending the Bosuo Flowers there

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.240
for processing is both the safest

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.160
and most secure option.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.090
Let's go to my place

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.540
and see if we can find

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.890
any other useful clues.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.220
Since the people in the Ghost Market

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:43.270
are so rule-abiding,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:44.730
what have you discovered?

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.440
Even the most rule-abiding people
fear death.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.970
Unlike the trading houses,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.510
the powders in the Ghost Market pharmacies

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.590
were collected
by someone specifically assigned.

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.240
Someone specifically assigned?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.490
Everyone entering the Ghost Market

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.720
must cover their faces.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.830
But the pharmacy staff said

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:58.850
the person who collected the powders
had a left hand

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.720
that was very limited in movement.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.790
It was wrapped in bandages

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.590
and looked as if it were injured.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.310
Someone with their left hand bandaged?

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.180
I believe he must be

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:07.240
one of Yesha's men.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.430
But this clue is too broad

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:09.960
to point to anyone specific.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.290
Still, something is better than nothing.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.720
Indeed.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.970
I'll send people
to investigate right away.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.320
Oh, right.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.450
How's your investigation into

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.720
Taoist Yunji's belongings going?

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.200
It's all

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.480
a jumble of things.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:25.680
There's even sugar.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:26.880
We really can't make

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.830
anything out.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.500
Where's my senior?

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.070
He hasn't found any clues,

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.240
so he went out for a walk

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.640
and hasn't returned yet.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.540
[11 PM]

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.200
[1 AM][3 AM][5 AM]

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.800
He's been gone for two hours.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200
I need to find him.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:36.850
Follow me.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.010
Where have you been?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.200
These are the three crime scenes

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.350
of the Four Symbols case.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.960
Beiming,

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.590
did you discover something?

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.720
I've uncovered the secret
behind the Four Symbols case.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.380
[Peace]

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.650
Bosuo Flowers.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
When inhaled by humans,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.310
it causes dullness of consciousness

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.400
and numbing of the five senses.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.110
But if insects come into contact with it,

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.400
they die instantly.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.110
So intricate.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.740
It's absolutely mind-boggling.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.040
If the method you described

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.170
really works,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.160
then next,

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.500
he will surely use it

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:24.680
to commit the Black Tortoise case.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.010
So when and where

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.230
will he strike again?

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.200
Here,

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:36.550
and here.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.920
According to my analysis,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:40.640
there are only a few places

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.240
where the final Black Tortoise case

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.640
could take place.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.160
The Heaven Worship Ceremony is tomorrow?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.560
Why hold it at such a time?

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.590
Won't that only make things more chaotic?

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:03.050
I understand His Majesty.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.020
The people of Qi Kingdom are in panic.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.790
Rumors that the kingdom will fall

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.030
and divine punishment is coming

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.440
are spreading like wildfire.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.720
Qi Kingdom
is in a state of fear and paranoia.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.400
If His Majesty
doesn't calm the people soon,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.200
the situation will only worsen.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.000
That's right.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.110
This is our only option.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.160
Previously,
preparing for a Heaven Worship Ceremony

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.070
took the Ministry of Rites

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.440
several months.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.920
Given the current situation,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.550
His Majesty wants it done
as quickly as possible.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.110
We can only choose a nearby auspicious day

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:28.310
and handle it simply.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.350
Where will the ceremony be held?

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.750
At the Heaven Worship Altar, of course.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.350
Now we know

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.780
when and where he plans

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.710
to commit the Black Tortoise case.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.020
Everything happening right now

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.370
is part of his plan.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.750
Demonized Four Symbols,

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.160
with each step linked to the next,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.360
is truly terrifying.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.810
But what is his goal

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.680
in doing all this?

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.240
The Heaven Worship Ceremony
is a grand ritual.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.110
His Majesty, the officials,

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.450
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.710
and the imperial family will all attend.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.600
His goal couldn't be...

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.640
To use this case

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.850
to make the officials—and even His Majesty
—of Qi Kingdom

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:04.000
take the Swift Wind Pill,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.480
turning them into monsters
in front of the people.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.790
Then he could,
under the guise of divine punishment,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:11.070
easily seize control of all of Qi Kingdom.

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.960
If that's really the case,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.320
we must enter the palace immediately

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.030
and ask His Majesty
to cancel the ceremony.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:15.920
It's too late.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:16.810
The imperial edict
has already been issued.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.030
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:18.110
If it were withdrawn,

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.240
the people would only think

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.240
His Majesty is afraid

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.100
of this so-called will of heaven.

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.160
Rumors would spread even more,

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.400
potentially shaking

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.270
the very foundation of Qi Kingdom.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.880
That would be far too dangerous.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.010
If Yesha really poisons the ceremony,

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:32.670
how can we defend against it?

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.360
Although I still haven't found

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.290
an antidote to the Swift Wind Pill,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.320
no one understands its toxicity

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.910
better than I do.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.590
These are bamboo sticks

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.110
soaked in a special solution I prepared.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.680
They can't neutralize the poison,

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.000
but when they come into contact
with the Swift Wind Pill,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.830
they turn black,

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:48.640
offering a degree of protection.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.400
Chiefs, please enter the palace at once

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.350
and inform His Majesty
of the seriousness of the situation,

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.310
then distribute these sticks

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.330
to the palace personnel

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.310
and officials,

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.790
asking them to carefully check

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:58.100
all food and drink

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.510
before consuming anything.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.620
But what if tomorrow

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:01.810
the Black Tortoise illusion

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:03.070
really occurs

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.800
and deceives the people again?

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:08.610
We won't give him another chance.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.750
Hail the deity!

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.750
We respectfully invite the Heavenly Emperor
to descend and receive the offerings!

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:14.680
Bow!

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.230
Rise!

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.030
First offering: jade and silk!

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.270
Bow!

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.310
Rise!

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.030
Second offering: grains!

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.440
Bow!

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.310
Rise!

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.750
Final offering: wine and food!

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:02.030
Ceremony complete!

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.200
Heavenly Emperor, please manifest

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.160
and bless Qi Kingdom.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.510
The emperor of Qi Kingdom is unjust.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.830
Heaven has abandoned him.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.480
Submitting to the new ruler

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.070
is what aligns with the will of Heaven!

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.480
The emperor of Qi Kingdom is unjust.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:23.910
He really came.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.650
Submitting to the new ruler

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.260
is what aligns with the will of Heaven.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.470
The emperor of Qi Kingdom is unjust.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.080
Heaven has abandoned him.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.030
Submitting to the new ruler...

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.400
Where is Xiao Beiming?

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.860
Why has it gone silent?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.420
Is it just this thing?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.310
Foreign lands really do have

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.400
quite a few strange things.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.610
Through this thing,

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.460
the so-called

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.610
divine beasts' decrees

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.070
can be spread into the sky?

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.200
What's going on?

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.350
What's happening?

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:22.480
I have no idea.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.160
I'll go out and check.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:23.640
Okay.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.300
Don't move if you want to live.

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.910
Step back.

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.240
Beiming, you were right.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.640
My Lords,

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.240
I'm not with him.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.550
I was forced into cooperation

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.920
after he captured me.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.220
So you're Taoist Yunji?

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.700
Yes, that's me.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:43.880
Taoist Yunji.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.240
We know you were coerced,

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.510
but the situation is urgent.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.840
There's something we need your help with.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.880
The demons have been vanquished!

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:58.480
Yesha has been slain!

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.880
Heaven's will returns to Qi Kingdom!

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.650
It will bless us!

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.380
The demons have been vanquished!

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.030
Yesha has been slain!

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.270
Heaven's will returns to Qi Kingdom!

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.710
It will bless us!

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.110
Heaven bless Qi Kingdom!

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.750
Turning the plan against him?

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.500
He's quite something.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.400
It worked.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.700
"Heaven's will returns to Qi Kingdom.
It will bless us."

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:33.500
Didn't expect you to be so brave.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.860
[One day ago]

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.440
What does this mean?

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.760
This is the method
of creating images with fire

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:50.880
recorded in the Book of Mechanics.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.550
By using a dark room and light,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.920
you can produce phantom illusions.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:56.400
This is one of the methods

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400
used in the Four Symbols case,

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.240
and the most crucial one.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.640
You mean

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.640
the divine beasts that appeared in the sky

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.160
were illusions, just like

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.550
the candle's reflection?

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:06.790
But the divine beasts

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.000
are so different

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.900
from the reflections in the sky.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:09.720
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:10.680
Could Yesha

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.510
have hung a cloth in the sky?

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.750
Exactly.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.400
That cloth

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.270
is the clouds in the sky.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:18.350
You mean

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.270
those divine beasts

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.200
were actually projected

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.130
onto the clouds?

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:21.830
Then where did

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.160
those clouds come from?

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.270
They were created

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.510
by Taoist Yunji

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:28.040
using the substances
in his jars and bottles.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.270
Celestial stone powder and sugar?

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:35.920
Exactly.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.110
By using celestial stone powder
and sugar as the main ingredients,

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.880
then mixing in various pigments,

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.740
one could produce colored smoke.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.390
Adding crystal powder to the mix

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.030
would allow the clouds

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.630
to reflect light and shadow.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:49.480
Most importantly,

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.650
they included

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.920
a large amount of Bosuo Flower pollen.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.400
Once the clouds rose into the sky,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.000
the pollen would drift down,

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.940
and the onlookers—

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:57.110
unaware—

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:58.480
would have their five senses numbed,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.680
making them more likely to believe

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.140
the illusion before them.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.830
But even if he could make those clouds,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.510
they weren't solid objects.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.600
How could he carry them around

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.030
and use them at will?

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.090
Of course he could.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.180
In Yunji Palace,

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:10.750
we found large quantities

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:12.210
of silk cloth and tung oil.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.310
When the silk was soaked in tung oil,

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.570
it became waterproof.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.070
By sewing them together,

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.680
they could make so-called
oil-silk pouches.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.650
Then he put the drug powders

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:21.640
inside these pouches,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.160
and when needed, opening them

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.310
would release

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.370
the colored smoke.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.680
Using this method,

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.510
whether for the illusion chambers

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.750
or the drifting clouds,

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.660
the setup would have to be deployed

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.590
from a height to work effectively.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.480
Follow me.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.720
Both the street
where the White Tiger case took place

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:44.990
and the execution ground
of the Azure Dragon case

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.240
[Tranquility]

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.880
happened to have watchtowers nearby.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.590
These watchtowers are meant
for city defense

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.110
and are not used in peacetime.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.720
I believe that, at the time,

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:53.690
Yesha's men were hiding atop

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:54.740
that watchtower.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.080
Then how do you explain the injuries

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.830
on Wu Zhui and Wu Lie's bodies?

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.770
Of course, they were faked.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.720
The bite and claw marks

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.960
on their bodies

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.510
were deliberately made

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.070
using the fangs of wild beasts.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.350
If Wu Zhui
had really died in a tiger's jaws,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.570
his body would show marks

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.400
from the tiger's tongue scraping him,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.240
and his corpse

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:16.160
would have been dull and yellowed.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.400
Once the bodies are returned,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.340
I want you to re-examine

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.870
Wu Zhui and Wu Lie's bodies.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:22.310
You want me to perform an autopsy?

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:24.550
The Four Symbols killings
never actually happened.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.750
It's all nonsense.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.870
We must have missed

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.960
some crucial clue.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.510
During the original examination,

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.310
Feng Qingzhuo was misled by the illusion
and jumped to conclusions,

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.570
so he didn't notice it.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.510
That was my oversight.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.900
We were also deceived

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:37.830
by Yesha at the time.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.270
Fortunately,
we discovered it before it was too late.

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.290
But how did he manage

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.350
to escape riding a dragon?

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.400
I had Fang Yin investigate the executioner

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.550
from that day,

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.350
only to find he had been missing
for several days.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.000
I suspect

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.110
he was either bribed by Yesha

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:48.240
or already dead.

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.160
Moreover,
the execution blade used that day

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.310
was fake.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.030
Smoke filled the stage,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.510
and while everyone's attention

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.240
was drawn to the Azure Dragon in the sky,

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.480
Yesha changed his appearance,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.550
left behind the shackles,

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.080
and blended into the crowd.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.140
That explains everything.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:06.930
No, that's not right.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:07.590
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.200
This method could indeed work for

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.340
the Azure Dragon and White Tiger cases,

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.270
but the Vermilion Bird case is different.

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.750
It happened in Feng Prison,
a Heavenly Prison.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.310
This method definitely wouldn't work.

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:18.000
Besides,
I fought with the Vermilion Bird myself.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.100
If it were just a phantom,

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.030
I would have noticed

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.000
immediately.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.440
As I just said,

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.830
this is only one method

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.350
used in the Four Symbols case.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:26.350
The Vermilion Bird case

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.680
employs a different technique

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.740
from the other two.

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.110
What do you mean?

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.140
The author of this book

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.490
was obsessed
with magical arts and illusions.

he witnessed in his lifetime in this book.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:43.880
Although he didn't know the key methods,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.440
I found clues

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:46.710
in his descriptions.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.860
What does it say?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720
This book records

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:50.200
the lifelong mastery

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.790
of Taoist Yunji.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.030
His "Thousand Miles Landscape"

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.310
was created using the method

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:55.270
I mentioned earlier.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.100
But Taoist Yunji

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.480
had another ultimate skill

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.680
called Mind Control.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.140

With the right technique,

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:06.770

what they were commanded to remember.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.110
The greatest use of Bosuo Flowers

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.030
lies in this.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.400
Are you saying

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.000
I was under Mind Control at that time?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.360
The Heavenly Prison was built underground,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.360
with each level's vents

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360
leading straight to the surface.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.710
These vents are extremely narrow.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:28.510
Only insects can pass through them,

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.370
so no one pays them any attention.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.550
But the Bosuo Flower pollen

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.880
could travel through these vents

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.340
all the way to the lowest level
of the prison.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.810
The prison was sealed,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.620
so inhaling

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.480
a large amount of Bosuo Flower pollen

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.210
in a short time would likely do more

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.690
than just numb the senses;

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.360
it would blur one's consciousness.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.880
I suspect that at the time,
it wasn't just you—

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.030

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.000
and even Wu Lie,

were all affected.

But how exactly

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.480
did we fall victim to it?

Mind Control

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.030
often only requires

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.550
some repeated actions or sounds

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.230
to subtly

trap a person.

someone will come to save you.

So that day,

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:03.630
all my memories of the Vermilion Bird

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.920
were fabricated?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.920
My mind was being controlled?

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.980
After you fainted,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.110
Zhuge Kongyun and I also arrived.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.370
Although we were late,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.530
we still noticed

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:13.950
some oddities about you.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.710
You said you entered the fire

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.230
and were knocked out
by the Vermilion Bird.

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.590
Zhuge Kongyun and I also went in,

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:20.120
but we didn't see anything.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:22.190
The entire Buddhist hall was made of wood.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.440
After the fire,

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.320
our shoe soles

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.800
were coated with some ash,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.860
but yours were completely clean.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.650
Moreover, there was

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.210
no trace of smoke on you.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.420
You claimed to have been knocked out

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.750
by flames expelled by the Vermilion Bird,

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.630
yet not a single strand of your hair

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.630
was singed or curled from the heat.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:39.960
All of this proves that

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.600
you never entered the fire,

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.880
nor did you see
the so-called Vermilion Bird.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.070
In other words,

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.010
the Vermilion Bird murder

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.710
was just a false memory implanted in me

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:49.960
through his control?

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.710
Making you

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.920
the sole witness

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.880
was his goal.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.280
The so-called Demonized Four Symbols

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.060
is nothing more than

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.190
an illusion created

00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:59.720
using unorthodox methods.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.220
Now that we've uncovered

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.430
all his methods,

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:05.010
the final Black Tortoise case...

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.670
We will certainly stop him.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.230
That's enough.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.760
Thank you.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.400
You were the one
who bought the Bosuo Flower pollen

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.230
in the Ghost Market, weren't you?

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:15.430
He trusts you so much.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.880
So let me see

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.810
your true face.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:21.670
Gong Fu?

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.360
Beiming,

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.440
you know him?

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.320
Remember what I told you

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.590
about Feng Bamao?

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.440
He's the supervisor

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.480
who was taken to take the blame.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.710
Your hand

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:32.190
was injured during

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.390
the Ministry of Justice's
forced confession, wasn't it?

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.960
I didn't expect you to remember me.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.130
You're also an orphan from Haiya?

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.930
That's right.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.030
Back then, my foster parents

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.110
sold me into the palace,

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:45.710
and I almost became a eunuch.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.840
By a twist of fate,
I ended up in the Ministry of Works.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.100
I didn't expect the world to be so unjust.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.070
Just because of some termites,

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:54.030
my left hand was crippled.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.000
Fortunately,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.630
I met Master then.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.920
Where is he?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:00.840
Tell me,

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.840
and I'll make sure you survive.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.150
Survive?

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:05.510
Do you think

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:06.910
I would betray Master

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.320
for my own life?

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.000
Your show is over.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.010
Sooner or later, we'll catch him.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.960
Over?

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.520
You think solving the Four Symbols case

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.760
will stop Qi Kingdom from falling?

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.590
Xueman!

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.810
We can't catch up.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.280
It's the Swift Wind Pill.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.500
These must have been prepared

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.360
for His Majesty
and the officials during the sacrifice.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.880
This time we stopped him.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:55.400
But once the Four Symbols case is solved,

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.710
if they get desperate

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.590
and start spreading poison
throughout the capital,

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:00.440
we won't be able to defend against it.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.760
I might know

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.920
where they are now.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:04.320
It's where

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:06.000
I was imprisoned before.
