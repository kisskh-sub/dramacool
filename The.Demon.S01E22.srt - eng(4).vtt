00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.599
No!

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:33.120
No!

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:34.599
No!

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.439
No way. Shang Xin can't die now.

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.560
Otherwise, everyone in the city
will be killed.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:57.319
You want to get rid of me?

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.560
Don't forget

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.799
all the citizens' primordial spirits

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:03.799
are with me.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.359
If you kill me,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.400
all of them will die.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.080
Come on.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.960
Kill yourself

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.240
and hand over the double demon cores.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:14.319
I'll lay the formation.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.400
You'll go stop Fan Dayao.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.319
Fan Dayao. You can't kill Shang Xin.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.279
Shen Wangchen.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:43.279
I failed to pick up

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.839
what you taught me.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.879
I just

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.319
don't want you to be sad.
