00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.439
Young Master!

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.680
You can finally touch people!

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.400
I can only touch her.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.200
Why so?

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.000
Because she's different.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.840
How different is she from the rest?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
Red bean soup?

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.519
Young Master.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.560
Why are you making
this signature dish of yours?

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.319
It's for her.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.920
That darned Fan Dayao!

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.319
How dare she force you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.200
to cook for her.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.879
Not only is she humiliating you,

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.040
but she's also shaming me!

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.040
I'm doing this of my own accord.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.879
Young Master.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.840
Have you fallen

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.120
for that cat?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.759
Yes.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.479
Take your time.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.080
So, what's it?

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:23.960
You can't stop yourself

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.280
from attacking others.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.960
And you can't get close to them

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
except for me?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.599
That's right.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.960
Done.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.199
Well...

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.039
Well, what's with

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.599
your divine power?

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.080
Well...

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.439
It's a long story.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.280
If it's a sad story,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.240
forget it.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.400
You just want
to get close to people, no?

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.120
If you want to,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.240
just get close to me.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.039
It's no big deal.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.840
After all,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.319
when you got close to me,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.360
I was quite happy.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.199
Thank you, Chief Fan.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.479
Don't mention it.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.960
You're my consort.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.840
Friends

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.159
never stand on ceremony.

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.719
Just touch and hug me

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:24.680
as you please.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.000
Shen Wangchen.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.400
How brilliant of you.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.680
You managed to turn these hard red beans

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.400
into something

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.039
so sweet and soft.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.560
I'd make

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.800
this red bean soup

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.439
whenever I missed my family.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.159
Why?

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.639
Because people believe

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.360
red beans are
the truest symbol of longing.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.360
Before parting, they would always
give each other red beans

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.639
to display their yearning.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.480
Got it.

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:27.759
Could I have another serving?

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:35.879
There's plenty more.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.360
Your Majesty.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:06.000
We sure have a lot of enemies.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.759
Apart from the demon slayers,

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:08.800
those trappers

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.360
are a real headache too.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.639
Well, why do they try to catch

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.480
these ordinary animals?

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.199
Who knows?

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.480
Shen Wangchen said

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:19.360
it wasn't their doing either.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.160
Who could it be, then?

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:25.240
Your Majesty.

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.720
When we catch them again,

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:30.517
we must teach them a lesson!

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.240
That won't do.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.560
As Shen Wangchen said,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.399
threats

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.279
aren't the right way.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600
His Highness is right.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.839
Go tell

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.040
those little creatures.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.519
This is my territory.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.199
If they dare set foot here again,

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:01.839
I'll eat them alive!

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.399
Your Majesty.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.800
All hail Your Majesty!

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.000
In the blink of an eye,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.839
I pried open that iron trap

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:26.120
and gently lifted the pup

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.879
out of it.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:27.360
Of course,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.639
it then showed me

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.639
its gratitude.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.360
Sadly,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.600
I still ended up being outsmarted

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.519
by that thing.

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:33.560
But I heard

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.079
your gave that pup

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.319
the fright of its life.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.120
News travels fast, huh?

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.160
Well, the situation was dire.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.920
Those little ones were playful

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.959
and always wandering there.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.600
So I did that to the pup

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.399
to make the rest think

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.680
there's a vicious demon in the woods.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.180
That way, they would never
dare go there again.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.480
That makes sense.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.959
Well...

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.000
I've finally mastered

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.079
my protective divine art!

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.319
Still, it needs bandages and medicine.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.279
Fine.

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:21.639
I shall let you

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.120
serve me.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:29.160
It may hurt a little.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.959
It's alright.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.720
Done.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.360
I'll tend to your wound again tomorrow.

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.800
For now, get some rest.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.079
I'll take my leave.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.600
I want to sleep with you.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.960
You're right.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:39.519
I have no friends.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.480
I'm pretty lonely too.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.360
So I've decided to listen to you.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.840
When you held me in your sleep,

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.159
I was beyond words.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.399
I want you by my side.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.120
I don't want to be alone.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.240
Not even for a moment.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.919
Stay with me.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.559
Please?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:29.919
Shen Wangchen.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.440
I've got you

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.480
these tonic herbs.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.679
Come out and bow...

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.240
What's going on?

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.519
Your Majesty.

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.639
Mr. Shen has run away.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:48.039
He even took the bedding with him!

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.679
He broke his oath,

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.919
abandoned me,

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:11.399
and fled.

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:13.639
And I nearly bought into

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.159
that human's lies!

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.120
Could it be

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:22.759
he schemed

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:24.320
to win my trust,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.000
make me lower my guard,

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:27.799
and run back to Moyuan City?

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.480
Jerk!

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.559
Yes, Your Majesty?

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.000
All of you, out!

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.440
Dayao!

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.279
Here's a letter from Mr. Shen.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.320
I said,

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.360
I'll never believe

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.279
that human again.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.240
Get lost!

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.159
Old Turtle.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.320
Go clean this place up.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.159
Let me rest a bit more.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.200
I'll do that right after.

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:05.159
It's only been a day
since Mr. Shen left,

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.440
and the whole fort is in chaos.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.039
Her Majesty's back to being

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:10.919
that hot-tempered tigress again.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.879
Do you think Mr. Shen

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:17.559
will ever come back?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.519
I doubt it.

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:20.799
He was taken here

00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:22.279
by Her Majesty in the first place.

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:23.919
What human would ever

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:25.080
choose to stay

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.279
with a bunch of demons?

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.440
Jiang Li.

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:40.559
When will you ever come back?

00:12:48.487 --> 00:12:51.062
(Aowu Fort)

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:54.360
Could it be

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.720
my demon core gave him the power

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:59.240
to defeat me?

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.879
Shen Wangchen.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:09.159
Give me back my divine power!
