[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.860
[Episode 22]

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.870
Beiming,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.229
the case hasn't been concluded yet.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.830
They won't

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.229
convict Xueman so quickly.

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.840
Besides, she's the daughter
of King Zhong of Constables

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.000
and a member
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.590
They wouldn't go so far as to torture her.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.039
I need to go to the Yaksha Temple.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.280
Beiming, your health now...

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
The top priority now

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.560
is for you to rest and recover.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.280
Leave the rest

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.400
to us.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.289
Don't worry about anything else.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.040
If Xueman didn't kill him,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.060
there must be evidence at the scene.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.080
When we came in last night,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.960
only Constable Zhong

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.560
and Old Bug's body were here.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.150
Where was Xueman?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.260
Constable Zhong was here.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.960
Old Bug's body was here.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.320
The two were more than eight feet apart.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.360
You said Old Bug was burned?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.000
Yes.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:23.960
When we arrived,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960
he was already beyond recognition.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.000
Whether Xueman used fire

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.430
to directly burn Old Bug to death

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.030
or set the corpse on fire after the murder
to destroy the evidence,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.840
there should have been

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360
traces of oil at the scene.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.540
There are indeed no traces of oil.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.120
But the Secret Investigation Unit thinks

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.750
the oil might have been cleaned up

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.960
by Constable Zhong.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.840
But

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.150
before she could escape,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.680
she was caught red-handed.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.520
Old Bug

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.450
fought with Xueman before he died.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.680
Do you smell

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.840
something strange?

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.010
It smells so familiar.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.380
Don't sniff it!

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.150
This is the Seven-Star Powder
from Poison Valley.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.120
The Seven-Star Powder?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.240
Once inhaled, you'll faint

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.440
within a few breaths.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.960
It seems Constable Zhong

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.820
was indeed knocked out by Old Bug.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.960
If what Madman said is true,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.240
that Constable Zhong passed out

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.770
soon after being poisoned,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.400
she couldn't possibly have killed anyone,

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.630
let alone burned the body.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.680
Isn't that evidence?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.360
No.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.960
They can claim

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.590
Xueman poisoned Old Bug.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.070
There's something I don't understand.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.200
There are so many ways to kill someone.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.300
Why did the murderer have to burn him?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.260
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.220
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.840
Smell this.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.930
This is strange.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.480
Burnt grass

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.810
should smell scorched.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.750
Placed next to a corpse,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.270
it should reek of decay.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.120
But this only

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.850
gives off a sickly sweet scent.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.850
Where does the smell come from?

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.659
We still need to examine the body.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.159
But Old Bug's body

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.800
was taken away
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.830
What are you afraid of? We just

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.190
storm in and examine it.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.310
You're the real madman.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.830
You think the Secret Investigation Unit

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.070
is a place you can just walk into?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.070
I have a plan.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.970
Tong Shuang.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.540
[Zuixian Restaurant]

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.760
Here's what you wanted.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.390
Thanks.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.050
One more thing.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.070
Who's on duty tonight?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.090
You're recovering well.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.600
Although your body is still weak,

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.730
your pulse is gradually stabilizing.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.630
I didn't expect that Old Bug

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.760
actually saved you.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.120
Old Bug was truly remarkable.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.270
Old Bug was obsessed with poison,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.480
but apart from my late master,

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.870
there was no one better at medicine

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.270
than him.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.560
Humans are complicated.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.150
Good and evil hinge on a single thought.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:05.630
Beiming!

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.720
Old Bug's body

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.870
is in Room A16.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:11.010
It's marked on this map.

[Zuixian Restaurant] [Prison]

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.750
What about the guards tonight?

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.750
The Secret Investigation Unit's guards

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.360
work in two shifts.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.310
Tonight's guards

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.920
are Dong Liang

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.630
and Wang Lang.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.920
They'll be there

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.920
before dark.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.720
It's about time. Let's go.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.510
Beiming,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.430
let me and Madman go this time.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.040
No.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.800
Beiming,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.830
I've always followed your orders before,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.830
but this time, you must listen to me.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.870
You just barely

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.310
escaped death.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.190
We can't let anything happen to you again.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.480
Feng Qingzhuo just took my pulse.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.270
The poison's been neutralized.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.190
And my internal energy is recovering.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.750
I'm fine.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.870
Just because
the poison's been neutralized,

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:40.870
we don't need to worry

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.390
about your health.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.760
That's exactly why we can't let you go.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.760
Constable Zhong is still in prison,

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.630
and Mr. Zhuge is
at the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.600
You know how difficult it is

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.560
to deal with him.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.390
If this mission fails

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.750
and you get caught,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.310
we'll all be finished.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.380
But...

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.480
No buts.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.830
For once,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:02.870
Brute said something smart

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.930
and used his brain.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.800
I agree.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.630
I agree too.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.510
Beiming,

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.070
stay here and wait for news.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.720
If

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.800
we're discovered,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.560
with you being free,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.620
there will still be hope for all of us.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.630
Don't worry, Beiming.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:15.510
Trust us.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.920
Trust us, Beiming.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.160
Alright.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.690
Feng Qingzhuo,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.360
be extremely careful.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.600
You must be cautious.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.390
Tong Shuang,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.430
don't act on impulse.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.950
Remember,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.310
listen to Miss Huo in everything.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.040
Don't worry.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.970
You are here to interrogate me?

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.720
What?

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.050
Are you worried I'll torture you?

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.310
You can try.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.870
I'd like to see

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.470
what Mr. Zhuge is capable of.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.160
You know me.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.430
I'm the kind of person

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.030
who hates all that violence.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.510
Only brainless fools

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.310
would resort to torture,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.720
such a cheap, low trick.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.160
His Majesty has given you and your father

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.270
three days.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.920
Old Bug is dead,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.630
so now,

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.760
your only card to turn the tables is me.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.920
If you don't use some means on me,

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.630
how are you going to turn things around?

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.960
Zhong Xueman,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.120
I think

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.380
you've grown smarter.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.590
No need to flatter me.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.030
Whatever you've got,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.360
just bring it on.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.600
Fine.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200
At the crime scene,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.630
there was indeed no evidence

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.390
proving a third person was present.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.440
So whether

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.480
you killed Old Bug or not,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.080
you are the prime suspect.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.550
This case is a big deal.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.870
It won't drag on for long.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.200
Once you're convicted,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.600
as a constable,

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.150
you'll certainly be sentenced to death

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.480
for deliberately killing a key criminal.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.860
Then why are you still wasting time here

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.100
with me?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.080
Just convict me already.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.960
You will be convicted.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.870
But what kind of conviction—

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.120
that's up to you, not me.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.640
What do you mean?

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.870
Old Bug was a key criminal

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.120
and a villain.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.300
His death is no loss.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.270
If you sign the confession,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.180
I can tell the Ministry of Justice

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.390
that you accidentally killed him

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.360
in self-defense during the arrest.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.030
Then you'll get a lighter sentence.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.120
Is this how the Secret Investigation Unit

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.840
handles cases?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.750
Special cases, special measures.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.030
If it weren't for you,

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.090
I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.030
[Confession: Criminal Zhong Xueman]

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.360
At the very least, it'll keep you alive.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.960
Am I supposed to thank you for that?

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.240
Just remember it in your heart.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:44.810
Put your fingerprint on it.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.030
[Confessor]

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.230
It'll save your life.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.000
You...

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.720
Black is black, and white is white.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.690
I won't admit to something I didn't do.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.910
At a time like this,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.440
can't you be wiser?

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:04.870
As a constable,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.210
I will never disregard justice.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.480
As an individual,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.790
I will never put self-preservation

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.030
above principles.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.670
But it's funny.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.670
I discussed you with someone recently.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.480
You discussed what about me?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.840
Both you and another famed constable

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.030
of the Qi Kingdom

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.860
once had no moral boundaries,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.480
using victims as bait to lure out killers.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.750
Even though the cases

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.240
were solved that way,
what meaning would it have?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.270
I never expected

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.390
that after all these years,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.920
you haven't changed at all.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.150
And you've become even more despicable,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.410
not even caring about the truth anymore.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.110
This is the Zhong Xueman I know.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.650
You're the one who hasn't changed at all.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.150
If you have nothing else to say,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.870
leave.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.690
I don't want to see you again.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.030
Zhong Xueman,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.440
this is your own choice.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.390
Don't blame me.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.030
We've still got night watch tonight.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.510
When will

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.670
this kind of life ever end?

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.730
Stop complaining.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.910
Once that woman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.710
confesses and admits her crime,

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.240
we'll be free.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.480
Right?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.280
You're right.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.150
Let's go.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.840
Let's go.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.120
Who are you?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.200
I think you've got the wrong person.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600
That should do it.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.550
We need to hurry,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.840
or there'll be trouble if they wake up.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.150
Here.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.200
If they wake up, just have Madman

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.530
give them another dose.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.330
Tong Shuang,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.440
once you
enter the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.600
you must not say a word.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.320
Why?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.960
As long as you remain silent,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.620
you won't give yourself away.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:10.480
Got it?

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.360
Got it.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.120
Today,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.510
I'm going to be a cicada in winter.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.210
What does that mean?

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.510
Completely silent.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.440
I'll wait here.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:27.880
If anything goes wrong,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120
I'll find a way to send you a message.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.870
Okay.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:36.550
Let's go.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.150
Madman.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.670
We won't get discovered, will we?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:44.480
Stop talking.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:25.630
[A16]

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.150
Come.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.080
Hurry.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.840
Oh no, Zhuge Kongyun.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.550
Smell this.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.550
This smell is very familiar.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.810
It's a bit sickly sweet,

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.790
like the fragrance

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.030
of burning oil blended with spices.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.150
Never mind.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.420
Let's take it back and study it first.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.440
Young Master, you're back.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.180
Why isn't there anyone on watch?

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:37.910
Yeah.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:38.910
Tonight, it should be

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.260
Dong Liang and Wang Lang on duty.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.240
Where are they?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.390
Step aside!

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.200
I am General Huo's daughter.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.030
Go out

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.910
and see what's happening.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:46.600
Yes.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.390
Young Master,

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.040
there's a drunk person
causing trouble at the gate.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.150
So noisy.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.240
Just send her away.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.900
She isn't an ordinary person.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.260
Maybe you should go take a look yourself.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.240
Step aside!

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.200
-That was our last bottle of wine.
-How dare you block my way?

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.240
We really don't have any more wine.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.720
-I'm General Huo's daughter.
-Please stop causing trouble.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.150
How dare you!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.080
What are you doing?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.600
I want to see Zhuge Kongyun!

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.660
What are you doing?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.120
Miss Huo.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.630
Zhuge Kongyun,

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.130
I want to see Zhong Xueman.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.080
Miss Huo, you must be drunk.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.600
I'm not drunk.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.030
I said I want to see Zhong Xueman.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.270
Zhong Xueman is a suspect.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:46.600
You can't see her
just because you want to.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.240
She's innocent.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.720
What right do you have to imprison her?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.320
Whether she's innocent or not

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.650
isn't for you to decide.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.630
What do you take

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.630
the Secret Investigation Unit for?

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.840
If you don't leave now,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.270
don't blame me

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.600
for not showing respect to the Huo family.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.840
Very good.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.030
If you dare,

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.690
just try laying a finger on me!

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.270
I...

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.890
Where did you two go?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440
Zhuge Kongyun!

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:18.270
I said

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.030
I want to see Zhong Xueman.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.680
What are you two standing there for?

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.940
Get her out of here now.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.790
Okay. Okay.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.030
Don't touch me.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.830
Don't touch me.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.830
I'll settle this with you later.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.270
Young Master,

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.960
I think I'd better get you

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.930
clean clothes and shoes first.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.150
Young Master.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.910
Young Master,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.480
I'll take your clothes

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.740
and shoes to be washed.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.400
Young Master.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.630
Young Master.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.110
Didn't you two

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:25.480
go send her away?

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.690
What happened?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:27.590
Send her away?

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.000
We were attacked by thugs during the day

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.960
and lost consciousness.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.830
When we woke up,
we were in a residential house.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.290
And our clothes and tokens

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.750
were stolen.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:37.750
Yes.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.720
We figured something must be wrong,

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.120
so we rushed back
to report to Young Master.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.820
Then those two men just now...

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.720
Thankfully, Miss Huo was quick-witted.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.110
Otherwise, we would have been in trouble.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.440
It wasn't my fault.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:53.750
I did exactly as Dairong told me.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.680
I didn't say a word.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.140
I only used sign language.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.090
How did the autopsy go?

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.000
Look.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:02.920
What is this?

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.160
I don't know.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:05.880
It was found

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.590
on Old Bug's corpse.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.480
This smell

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.110
is extremely similar

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.640
to the smell of those weeds we found

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.300
at the Yaksha Temple that day.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.270
There's indeed something strange

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.640
about his corpse.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.400
Yun,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.830
Old Bug is dead.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.160
There are only two days left.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:36.830
How should we explain

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.240
to His Majesty?

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:39.680
If we want to save

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.030
our lives

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.590
and the future
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:48.070
there's only one way now.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.110
What's that?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:52.510
Zhong Xueman.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.680
But... But there are still

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.810
many unresolved aspects in this case.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.400
Then Father, please find a way

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.830
to pin all the charges

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.630
on Zhong Xueman within two days.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.480
We already found Old Bug

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.880
within three days,

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.400
but he was killed by Zhong Xueman.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.030
So we shouldn't be blamed.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.750
As long as Zhong Xueman is convicted,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.110
we'll have an explanation for His Majesty.

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:18.170
Tomorrow morning,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.060
tell the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.530
to jointly interrogate Zhong Xueman.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.480
Zhong Xueman,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.200
I have investigated

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.930
the entire matter thoroughly.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.770
All the evidence

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.310
[Upright and Honest]

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.920
shows that you killed Old Bug.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.720
Do you have anything else to say?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.160
I'll say it again—

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.400
I didn't kill him.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.770
Claiming innocence requires evidence.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.640
Do you have any evidence

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.240
to prove your innocence?

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.030
No.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.270
Since you have no evidence

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.070
to prove your innocence,

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.350
we'll proceed according to the law.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.160
Zhong Xueman, as a constable,

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.680
knowingly broke the law,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.000
resorted to unauthorized punishment,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.070
and cruelly killed a key criminal.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.880
That's an extremely heinous act.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.110
She should be sentenced to death.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.960
Zhong Xueman's crime
doesn't warrant death, right?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.750
That's right.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.960
It's not that serious.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.750
Indeed.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.850
Zhong Xueman's motive for killing
is insufficient.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.200
This conviction

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.650
seems rather hasty, doesn't it?

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.270
We all know

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.750
Zhong Xueman's temperament.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.750
Old Bug was connected to Yesha,

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.440
and Yesha is the murderer

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.880
of Zhong Xueman's father.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.200
It's entirely possible
she'd take the law into her own hands.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.270
That's her motive for killing.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:38.640
Not just that.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.880
From what I know,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.240
it has something to do with Zhong Xueman

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.920
that the Yesha case remains unsolved.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.480
Zhuge Tong,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:48.680
don't you think

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.590
you're talking nonsense?

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.400
Since the Yesha case,

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.790
the corpse-sewing case,

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:56.990
the Huo Zongyao case,

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.030
the Chu Guangsha case,
and the Yellow Heaven case

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.880
are all related to Yesha.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.750
Or rather,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.350
they were committed
by Yesha's subordinates.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.400
And the culprits?

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.810
Xiao Beiming's whereabouts are unknown.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.000
Huang Wuchang was taken away.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.270
The other criminals we could arrest

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.640
committed suicide to escape punishment.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.590
Who investigated

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:19.750
all those cases?

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:20.790
You already know the answer.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.650
Of course it was Constable Zhong.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.830
So you do know it was Constable Zhong.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.000
In the corpse-sewing case,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.110
Xiao Beiming escaped

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.170
by jumping off the cliff
right in front of Zhong Xueman.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.310
Then he showed up again

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:40.110
to poison Mr. Shen Bi to death.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.750
Then he disappeared.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.160
In the Huo Zongyao case,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.270
a maid from Huo Mansion

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.960
was Xiao Beiming's subordinate.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.000
Right in front of Zhong Xueman,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.720
a skilled fighter,

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.440
she managed to snatch a blade
and kill herself.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.750
Huang Wuchang was taken away.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.960
But before he was handed over

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.070
to the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.680
he had been escorted by Zhong Xueman
the whole time.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.440
It's possible she followed us secretly

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.110
and waited for the right moment to act.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.680
We tracked down Old Bug,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.550
and he also died

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.640
in front of her.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.000
Were all those things

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.110
just coincidences?

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.190
I have reason to suspect

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.400
that Zhong Xueman has been helping

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.000
Yesha, Xiao Beiming, commit his crimes.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.030
After all, Xiao Beiming

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.480
and Zhong Xueman
are childhood sweethearts,

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.510
and he was her husband.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.310
Zhuge Tong...

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.720
I believe

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.720
Zhong Xueman has deliberately obstructed
the Yesha case's investigation

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.160
and committed murder.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.900
Her crimes are unforgivable!

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.270
Zhuge Tong,

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.640
your words are baseless,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.070
and you're making false accusations!

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.640
You're using such far-fetched reasons

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.750
to hastily convict Constable Zhong.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:45.850
I'm afraid you have selfish reasons.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.310
Chief Fang,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.240
do not slander me.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:51.070
Zhong Xueman

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.130
is from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.350
You're disregarding the law

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:56.310
and shielding her here publicly.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.590
Who has selfish reasons here?

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.970
Even if Zhong Xueman is guilty,

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.200
this is a special case,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.960
and her identity is special.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.920
Shouldn't we detain her,

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.550
report to the higher-ups step by step,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.310
and wait for His Majesty's approval

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.110
before sentencing her according to law?

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.590
That won't be necessary.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.850
What do you mean?

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.270
Since she's been convicted,
and the case has been closed,

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.200
there's no need to detain her.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.720
There are still four hours

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.160
until noon.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.240
Once it's noon,

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.160
we'll just execute her in public.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.920
Zhuge Tong, have you lost your mind?

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.640
Do you have a problem with that?

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.570
According to the Qi Kingdom's law,

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.270
even if the case is closed,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:38.990
and the criminal is sentenced to death,

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.310
[Upright and Honest]

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:41.270
we must report three times

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:43.070
and wait for His Majesty's final decision

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.510
before the execution date is set!

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.960
Don't you think you're being absurd?

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.530
[Imperial: Annihilate the Evil]

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680
Absurd?

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.250
His Majesty has allowed

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.070
the Secret Investigation Unit
to handle the Yesha case

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.070
under special procedures.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:10.880
For anyone related to the Yesha case,

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.960
no court trial is required.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.640
Once they're convicted in the joint trial,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.300
execution can be carried out
before reporting.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.510
Chief Fang,

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.730
do you have any objections?

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.550
Chief Zhuge,

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.280
is this how you handle cases?

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.550
The Elite Constabulary Unit

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.270
sharing a reputation
with the Secret Investigation Unit

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:43.720
is a disgrace!

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.200
At the third quarter past noon,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.350
the criminal, Zhong Xueman,
shall be executed in public

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.110
to purge evil deeds!

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.880
Well, Beiming,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.250
have you figured it out?

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.180
At the crime scene,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.270
there indeed wasn't
a third person present.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.070
Constable Zhong
couldn't possibly be the killer.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.550
Something terrible has happened!

00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:23.350
Beiming.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.440
What happened?

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.270
The Secret Investigation Unit has finished
interrogating Constable Zhong.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.070
They're going to behead her in public
at the third quarter past noon.

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:32.070
Uncle!

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.200
Uncle!

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.070
Chief!

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.240
Uncle!

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.400
He should be in the study.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.000
Let's go.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.510
Uncle!

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.240
At a time like this,

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.000
how can you still be in the mood

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.880
to draw that?

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.270
Chief,

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.310
the case hasn't been fully investigated.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.030
How can they convict her
and set the execution date?

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.480
That old bastard Zhuge Tong—

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.960
this's a blatant disregard for human life!

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.720
And this isn't just targeting Xueman.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.400
He's bullying

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.640
the Elite Constabulary Unit!

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.030
Zhuge Tong has an imperial jade pendant.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.440
What do you want me to do?

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.590
Defy orders?

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:07.550
We still can't let him

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.400
bully the Elite Constabulary Unit
like this.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.440
If word gets out,

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.270
how are we supposed
to show up in public after this?

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.870
We'll be the laughingstock!

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.210
There's nothing we can do now.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:19.760
Things have come to this point.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:20.770
Do you expect me

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:22.370
to lead all our men

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.270
with weapons

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.920
to storm the execution ground?

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.850
Fang Tianzheng!

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.270
Don't forget

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.920
we watched

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.110
Zhong Xueman

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.110
grow up.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.920
Uncle,

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.400
stop drawing!

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.860
Can't you think straight?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.680
How dare you!

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:40.680
Is that how you speak to me?

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.880
I, Fang Yin, have never amounted to much.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:59.880
Zhong Xueman has always looked down on me.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.940
But this is the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.790
We are constables.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.040
When we're bullied or mocked

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:08.270
in normal times,

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.680
we can swallow it

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.680
and tolerate it.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.080
But at a moment like this,

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.440
are we still going

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.700
to keep swallowing it and tolerating it?

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.680
Even if the wrongfully accused

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.810
isn't Zhong Xueman,

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.550
it's still a human life!

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.200
-Chief.
-Chief.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.160
Isn't that Constable Zhong

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.160
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.450
How did she end up like this?

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.790
I heard she killed someone

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.400
and will be publicly beheaded.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.530
She killed someone?

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.200
How could Constable Zhong kill anyone?

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.550
Who can say for sure?

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.590
Her senior is a wanted criminal.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.640
What's so strange

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.320
about her killing someone?

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.070
Constable Zhong would never kill anyone.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.200
She's a good person.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.440
She must have been wrongfully accused.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.680
The Elite Constabulary Unit
has been corrupt for ages.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.000
Who knows how many criminals

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.400
they've failed to catch?

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:27.960
Say one more word

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.220
and I'll rip your mouth open!

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.090
You slapped me? You shrew!

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.070
I...

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.920
Bro. Bro.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.850
It hurts.

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.510
Get lost!

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.480
Okay.

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.830
What are you doing?

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.310
We're going to rescue Constable Zhong.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.070
Even if it costs us our lives,

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.350
we must save her.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.350
You can't save her this way.

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.280
You'll just die for nothing.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.240
But we can't just

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.000
watch her get beheaded.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.550
Let's go.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.070
Now, only one person

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.790
can save her.

Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.200
Don't look at me like that.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.920
You brought this upon yourself.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.790
You're despicable.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.070
Chief, it's almost time.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:29.510
Proceed with the execution.

Chief Fang,

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.760
why have you brought your men

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.920
from the Elite Constabulary Unit here?

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:30.150
Planning to storm the execution ground?

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:31.150
Zhuge Tong,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.610
I advise you not to be so despicable!

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.800
And leave yourself a way out!

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.900
The case against Zhong Xueman

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.230
is riddled with doubts,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.190
yet you've acted unjustly and unlawfully,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.710
defying reason and justice!

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:44.360
Your conduct is worse
than that of a beast!

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.030
I've already reported to His Majesty,

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.290
and he will punish you!

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.230
Has His Majesty replied?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.440
You want His Majesty to punish me.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.550
Fine.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.280
Once the execution is over,

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.440
I'll bind my own hands and feet

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.550

to face His Majesty's interrogation.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:03.400

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.440

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
what this is.

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.280
If I don't take the antidote

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.710
within an hour,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.670
I will die on the spot.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.360
I came here

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.400
to save Zhong Xueman.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.710
If you insist on beheading her,

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.480
once I'm dead,

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:10.230
everything about Yesha

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.150
will vanish with me.

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:13.960
The Yesha case

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:16.240
concerns the safety of the Qi Kingdom.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.820
You know the pros and cons.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.400
Chief Zhuge,

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.440
it's up to you.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:39.030
Xiao Beiming,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.440
as long as you surrender yourself,

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.360
I can stop

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.190
the execution of Zhong Xueman.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.320
Her case can be investigated again.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.000
With all these witnesses,

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:54.880
