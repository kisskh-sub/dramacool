You're so slow.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.150
Move it.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:45.070
Go.

Come on, keep moving!

[Nanren Lane]

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280
Someone's following us.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.860
Don't look back. Keep moving.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.470
Okay.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.150
Young Master.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.010
Where are they?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.180
They went that way.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.240
Excuse me.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.000
Excuse me.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.060
What are you doing?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.560
Why is a grown man like you
wearing a bamboo hat?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.680
I just found it.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.010
Mind your own business.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.550
They must be hiding in the crowd.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.360
Young Master,

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.430
should we seal off this area?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.680
This is the Nanyue people's territory.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.000
How can we seal it off?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.920
Don't worry, I have my ways.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:35.190
Sorry about this.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.150
This sedative is harmless.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.360
You'll wake up

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.270
in just four hours.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.000
Bear with it.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.120
Come.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.920
Zhuge Kongyun has discovered you.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.360
He's probably

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.820
not certain of my presence

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.270
and is afraid of alerting us,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.270
so he's been

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.190
tracking us secretly.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.070
Good thing I got rid of
the bamboo hat earlier.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.240
Once this case is closed,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.630
I'll settle scores with him.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.870
Let's focus on the investigation first.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.600
Thank you.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.659
The one in the middle must be Sada.

Zhong Xueman.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.890
Marquis Jingshan?

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.510
The crippled marquis.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.770
The crippled marquis?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.190
After Nanyue was destroyed,

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.600
a member of the royal family

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.560
fled with his family

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560
to the Qi Kingdom.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.720
He was hunted down on the way.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.120
To protect his family,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.720
he drew the pursuers away

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.750
and was pushed off a cliff.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.070
How come he didn't die?

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.430
He survived,

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.190
but his legs were severely injured,
leaving him disabled.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.160
His Majesty was merciful.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.270
After hearing about this,

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.600
he not only took them in,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.750
but even granted him
a mansion and a title.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.750
He also followed the marquis's suggestion

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.750
and gave him land

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.760
to shelter Nanyue refugees.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.870
That became what was known as Nanren Lane.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.090
So this marquis seems to be

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.550
a man of honor and loyalty.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.260
How come he believes in these things too?

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.510
The Saintesses have appeared.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.370
Follow my lead.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.000
Should we go rescue them?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.510
Acting now would alert the enemy.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.120
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.510
We might be able to find

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.680
clues about
the corpse-sewing case from them.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.810

Do you know who I am?

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.910
Release me at once!

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.480
Of course I know who you are.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.320
We met earlier.

Sada from Blossom Skies.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.400
Since you know that,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.940
how dare you manhandle me?

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.240
Be careful or I'll have Blue Heaven

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.030
take you away.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.320
Take us away?

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.630
I dare you.

Where have you hidden

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.440
the Saintesses from the altar?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440
Tell us the truth.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.000
The Saintesses were chosen by Blue Heaven

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.750
to be his companion.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.970
How could people
vanish into thin air?

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.000
You clearly pulled a trick.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.080
Speak.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.120
If you don't tell us,

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.250
I'll send you to the heavens right now.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.500
This is luminous stone powder, isn't it?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.080
You used fireworks

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.750
to distract everyone's attention.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.550
Then you took the opportunity to

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.480
scatter the luminous stone powder

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.120
hidden in your sleeve
into the fire basin on stage.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.790
When luminous stone powder met fire,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.550
it produced

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.210
an extremely dazzling light.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.030
People closed their eyes

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.490
against the bright light.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.920
And that was when you

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.960
made those Saintesses disappear.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.080
Easy for you to say.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.270
Even if I could make everyone
close their eyes,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.030
how could I possibly make

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.390
five people vanish in an instant?

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.360
It's simple.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.920
The altar is hollow underneath.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:40.720
Once the holy light appeared

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.000
and everyone closed their eyes,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.510
you activated the mechanism
to open the trapdoor,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.440
making the Saintesses
fall beneath the altar.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.200
This way,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:46.960
you created

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.630
the illusion that the Saintesses

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.080
vanished with the holy light
before everyone's eyes.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.840
You've been using this

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.480
cheap old trick

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.670
to swindle money.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.790
Nonsense!

Don't try to frame me!

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.200
Frame you?

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.000
Then what's behind here?

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.480
We're from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.880
We're here to rescue you.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.960
Speak!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.000
Where did these women come from?

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:32.910
They're all from Nanyue.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.130
Some were sold by their families.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.240
Others

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.390
were abducted by Blossom Skies.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.790
You brought them here

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.080
so that Hu Shisan

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.150
could sell them?

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.100
After each sacrifice,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.840
I bring them here

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.750
and give them to Hu Shisan

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.360
for money.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.150
Where is Hu Shisan now?

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.390
I don't know.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.630
He usually waits for me

here every time.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.440
It's strange that you all

of the women you've sold?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.360
Yes, there are records.

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.840
Hu Shisan keeps records.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.640

that Hu Shisan keeps records.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.390
I should take them back instead.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.750
You don't know martial arts.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.810
If they're intercepted on the way,
we'll be in trouble.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.910
I'd better go.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.050
Keep an eye on him for me.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.550
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.870
To think that such things are happening

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.670
right under the Emperor's nose.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.050
They're all witnesses.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.200
The Blossom Skies case is significant.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.320
I think we should

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.300
report this matter

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.120
to Chief Fang.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:51.510
Senior,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.200
I have one more favor to ask.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:53.960
Xueman,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.910
there's no need for formalities

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.750
between us.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.150
Just say it and I'll do it.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.670
They're all refugees from Nanyue.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.750
After being trafficked,

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.720
they've suffered unimaginable torment.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.320
After taking their statements,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.910
please make arrangements.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.610
If they still have family,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.290
personally escort them home,

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.290
and if they have nowhere to go,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.840
please

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.370
find them a way to survive.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.670
Don't worry.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:25.640
What are they doing?

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.790
If I'm not mistaken,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.360
this is a Nanyue ritual

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.360
to give blessings to you

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.510
in gratitude.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.960
We've searched everywhere

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.490
without finding anything.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.320
Did Sada lie to us?

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:49.150
Thank you.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.320
For what?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.720
If it weren't for you

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.320
blocking that strike for me,

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:56.550
I would've died by that man's sword.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.200
Thanks for saving my life, of course.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.120
We're in this together now.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320
If you died,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.150
it would affect the investigation.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.360
Hey, you...

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.550
Never mind.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.850
I'll definitely repay you.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.010
How do you plan to repay me?

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.990
I haven't figured it out yet,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.200
but I will eventually.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.720
I don't want to owe you.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.960
Thanks, Little White Dragon.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.220
Listen, I'm telling you,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.130
don't call me that name

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.000
in public.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.840
Weird.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.910
I've noticed

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.040
that you're becoming

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.250
more and more like a decent person.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.440
Could it be

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.330
that you were actually framed?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.480
What do you think?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.270
Though you're a coroner,

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.200
you're also a registered constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.030
You should learn more from Constable Zhong

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.150
to remain skeptical

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.200
about everything

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.840
and not trust anyone easily.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.080
What if everything

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.150
I've been doing

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.680
was just to manipulate you?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.910
Manipulate me?

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.030
Thinking about all that is tiring.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.000
I only know

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.390
you saved my life,

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:17.810
so even if you're using me, it's worth it.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.200
Besides,

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.240
I don't think Constable Zhong

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.170
distrusts you as much as you think.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.170
What do you mean?

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.630
Look.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:27.150
Just as you said,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.850
she's suspicious

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:29.870
of everything.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.750
She's afraid of losing sight of you,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:32.910
so she keeps you chained up

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:34.080
for fear you might escape.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.000
But that day when she found out

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.700
you took the wrong medicine and collapsed,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.150
the way she panicked...

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.940
didn't look like someone

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:43.870
dealing with her father's killer.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.150
Maybe she just feared that if I died,

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.950
the case would remain unsolved.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.120
Just like how

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.480
a corpse can't lie,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.720
a living person

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.320
also can't fool themselves.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.440
If she truly

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.630
doesn't believe in your innocence,

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.910
she would be doing everything

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.510
to find evidence

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:00.870
to lock you up in the Heavenly Prison,

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.030
instead of searching for

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.750
Hu Shisan

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.400
or Sada while carrying the charge

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.640
of harboring

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.700
a wanted criminal.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.960
It's like she's grabbing onto a lifeline.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.220
She's trying so hard to prove something.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.010
What is she trying to prove?

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.920
You know better than I do, don't you?

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.150
About Sada's matter,

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.030
I still have questions.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.760
I need you to help me

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.890
develop a medicine.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.270
Why are you here?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.140
Constable Zhong,
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.110
What do you want?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.680
I'm here for someone.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:57.960
Who are you looking for?

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.830
Are you still trying
to hide it at this point?

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.680
This is not the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.350
This is not a place where you can

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.680
act however you please.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.510
Do you know the punishment for harboring

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.590
a wanted criminal?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.920
I never would have imagined

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.000
that you would hide him

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.060
right by your side.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.460
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.310
Still not coming out?

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.210
Do you want to watch me die here?

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.400
Long time no see.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.260
It's been three years.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.720
I still won.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.310
You—

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.830
Who are you?

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.640
I was about to ask you that!

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.180
Why'd you steal my hat?

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.730
Do you not have any at home?

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.750
You—

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.750
This is the new constable
from the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.400
Tong Shuang.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.200
And this is the son of the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.720
the top investigator of Qi Kingdom.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.700
I just didn't expect

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.440
you'd be so interested

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.570
in his hat.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.140
Playing tricks on me, are you?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.040
Then what about these bloodstains

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.960
on the floor?

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.880
Has there been a murder here?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.740
You'd better explain yourself clearly.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.830
Mr. Zhuge, you have sharp eyes.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.070
This is animal blood.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.400
Recently,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.400
I've developed

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.310
a new type of medicine

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:52.830
that can nourish the kidneys.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:53.640
However,

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.030
it requires a lot of animal blood

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.830
to produce

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.160
and it smells terrible.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.880
Only Constable Zhong

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.550
-allows me to produce it, so...
-Do you think I’ll believe

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.680
that story?

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.280
This is clearly human blood!

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.850
What are you doing?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.240
Young Master!

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.750
Are you alright, Young Master?

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.920
Mr. Zhuge indeed has sharp eyes.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.790
This is human blood.

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.680
However,

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.440
it's Constable Tong's blood.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.200
A few days ago,
Constable Tong was feeling unwell,

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.110
so I gave him

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.750
this medicine,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.030
which expelled some bad blood.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.160
Seems like Young Master's health is poor.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.830
Coroner Feng,

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.550
you should give him a few more pills.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.240
This time is just a warning.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.550
Next time you trespass into my home,

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.400
you won't just be

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.480
coughing up blood.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.480
Slowly.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.640
Be careful.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.590
That guy looks so effeminate,

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.270
wearing red clothes at night

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.550
like some kind of ghost.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.480
What a hypocrite,

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.200
putting on such airs.

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.530
Where is Xiao Beiming?

this place?

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.960
After that incident,

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:27.590
this place became known to be cursed

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.590
and lost all its business.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.160
The owner later fell ill and died

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.640
and this loft was sold cheaply,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.160
so I had Tong Shuang buy it.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.350
I sealed the main entrance

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:36.880
and created a secret passage
for easy access.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.220
In the entire capital,

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.380
there's probably no place

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.510

when those Saintesses were sold

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.990

This dirty money

was earned with the blood and tears

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.240
of countless women.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.440
Look at the last page.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:16.980

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.070
There were five in total.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.950
Four women

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.410
were all sold by Hu Shisan

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.270
and then redeemed later.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.970
Then all four became victims
of the sewing murder.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.480
Only Hibiscus wasn't sold.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.240
This Hibiscus could very well be

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.680
the key to solving

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.080
the corpse-sewing case.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:36.960
Hibiscus is obviously an alias.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.640
There's not even a portrait of her.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.400
How can we find her among the masses?

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.330
There's a place.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:50.640
Officers,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.950
are you letting me go?

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.640
My lady, why are you here?

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:55.720
I'm already locked up here,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.480
and you still won't leave me alone.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.960
My lady, I know I was wrong.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.960
Please spare me just this once.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:00.680
Do you know a woman

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.750
named Hibiscus?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.930
I don't know her.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:03.890
Never heard of her.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:04.510
Two months ago,

00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:05.450
five women from Nanyue

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.240
were brought

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.720
to your boss Hu Shisan,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.240
but only four of them were sold.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.640
The remaining one was called Hibiscus.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.830
Ring any bells now?

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.590
The boss said

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.960
we must get her back.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.110
Otherwise,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.550
all of us

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.720
will die.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:19.720
I remember now.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.200
There was one

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.310
who escaped at that time.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.440
I led people to chase after her.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.160
Where did she go after you caught her?

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.240
I handed her over to our boss, of course.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.030
As for what our boss

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:28.830
did with her,

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.200
I have no idea.

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.030
Are you sure

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.720
Hibiscus wasn't among those women?

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.400
Yes.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.640
We were the ones

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.750
who delivered those women

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.790
to the brothels.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.830
Hibiscus definitely wasn't there.

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.030
Each sacrifice

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.550
has five Saintesses.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.070
If the women who died

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.530
in the corpse-sewing case

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.680
were the Saintesses

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.210
sacrificed two months ago,

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.270
then could the remaining one

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.270
be the Tailor's

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.160
next target?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.260
The Tailor uses the Four Devils Formation

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.720
and red clothes to curse the dead.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.000
If he wanted to kill five people,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.550
the Four Devils Formation
wouldn't make sense.

00:25:57.550 --> 00:25:58.440
Either way,

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.240
we need to find out

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.570
that woman's identity.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.680
We might find clues about Hu Shisan.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.270
Tell me the address

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.930
of where you caught Hibiscus.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.350
This is the place

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.880
the trafficker mentioned.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:28.750
The house is so clean.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.710
Someone must be living here.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.530
There's a backyard.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.210
[Dingfeng Pavilion]

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.110
Is the poison taking effect?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.810
What's wrong with him?

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.480
Thanks to Coroner Feng's acupuncture,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.480
I feel much better.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.550
I think that Blood-freezing Frost

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.790
won't dare to harm me.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.850
Did you find Hibiscus?

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.940
Hibiscus is already dead.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.350
This must be a fresh grave.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:14.160
Strange.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.030
Who would put a grave

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.590
in their own backyard?

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.030
Look!

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.400
Hu Shisan was also sewn and murdered?

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.030
That's right.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.480
The body was sent to
the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.640
and the trafficker confirmed

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.480
it was Hu Shisan.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.110
So there weren't just
four victims of sewing murder

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.240
but five.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.550
What about Hibiscus?

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:36.030
How do you know she's dead?

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:37.160
That grave.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.160
There were hibiscus flowers planted
in front of the grave.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.200
Hibiscus flowers don't grow in Nanyue,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.880
yet she called herself Hibiscus.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.840
The hibiscus must have carried

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.960
a special significance for her.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.030
So I deduce that

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.200
the hibiscus flowers
are Hibiscus's tombstone.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.550
You dug open the grave?

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.830
There was a female corpse

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.270
that had been dead
for at least two months.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.720
The body wasn't completely decomposed,

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.240
and the trafficker confirmed

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.440
the body was Hibiscus's.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.030
The body showed

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.270
signs of beatings.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.110
The cause of death was a fractured skull

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.510
from blunt force trauma.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.310
The coroner's examination revealed

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.070
she was pregnant when she died.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.040
These are the clothes
she never finished making.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.510
What else did the trafficker say?

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.480
Two months ago,

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:16.550
after the sacrifice,

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:17.110
the five Saintesses

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.770
were sent to Hu Shisan's home.

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.200
Hibiscus once tried to escape.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.590
How did Hibiscus escape?

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.830
And how did you

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.480
catch her again?

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.160
She just ran away secretly.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.590
At first, we didn't know

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.400
where to look for her.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.860
It was the other four girls

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.160
who told us where she went.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.400
But the remaining four Saintesses

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.930
betrayed her whereabouts.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.400
The traffickers went to Hibiscus's home

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.550
and took her back.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.010
No one knows what happened

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:40.310
after that.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.310
I believe that afterward,

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.000
Hu Shisan, in a fit of rage,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.550
beat Hibiscus to death.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.590
Then we're done for.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.880
The trail has gone cold again.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.070
Those responsible for Hibiscus's death

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.110
aren't just the four courtesans
and Hu Shisan,

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.270
but others as well.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.110
Sada.

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:57.070
Sada?

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.750
Then we should have

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:58.440
gone after him

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.770
when we discovered him.

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.960
I know where he is.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:01.960
Do you remember

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.350
what weapons
those two men in black

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.750
who kidnapped Sada used?

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.240
One used a mace. The other used a sword.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.720
Their techniques were brutal,
their skills profound.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.650
They're definitely not nobodies.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.510
They're the guards from
Marquis Jingshan's Mansion.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.000
Marquis Jingshan is also from Nanyue,

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.940
so his worship of Blossom Skies

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.680
is quite understandable.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.570
But the fact that he sent

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.400
his two personal bodyguards

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.440
to rescue Sada

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.790
indicates their relationship

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:29.640
is far from ordinary.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.480
I wounded one of those men in black

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.960
in the shoulder.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.640
If we go to the marquis's mansion
to verify the wound,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.790
we can prove the identity
of those men in black.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:39.050
Then we can follow the trail to find Sada.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:44.750

to build such a grand mansion?

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.400
Marquis Jingshan must be connected

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.400
to Blossom Skies.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.030
Did you find out
about his household's situation?

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.960
Yes, I did.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.270
Marquis Jingshan has an only son

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.000
named Ajia.

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:56.750
He's in his early twenties
but is very mysterious.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.160
They say he never leaves the mansion,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.880
so very few people have seen him.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.000
An only child, in his twenties,

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.000
rescued by personal guards...

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.310
This Ajia sounds a lot like Sada.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.480
We'll find out once we investigate.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.750
Let's make a stir.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.680
This is all that Xueman

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680
could find out.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.640
Come on.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.880
Hurry up, I'm starving.

I don't know what you're talking about.

Trespassing into the Marquis's mansion
is a capital offense.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.440
Either surrender now

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.790

Do you know where you are?

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.200
Of course I do.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.110
You know,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.790
yet you still dare to cause trouble?

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.880
I'm just investigating a case.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.010
You're investigating Blossom Skies.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.940
But even if Blossom Skies

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.400
is connected to the Nanyue people,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.460
you should realize

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.410
this is the marquis's mansion.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.550
Blossom Skies uses sacrifices as a cover

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.550
to traffic Nanyue refugees.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.070
The four victims in the corpse-sewing case

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.000
were all Saintesses
chosen by Blossom Skies.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And among all the Nanyue people,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.110
the only one with such power

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.310
is Marquis Jingshan,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.680
so I suspect that Blossom Skies's leader

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.510
Sada

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.240
is hiding within this mansion.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:52.830
You say Blossom Skies's leader

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.160
is hiding in Marquis Jingshan's Mansion?

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.160
Do you have any evidence?

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.790
I caught Sada last night,

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.980
but he was rescued by two men in black.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.340
It's these two right here.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.670
Is this true?

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.590
We are

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:14.320
Marquis Jingshan's personal guards.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.710
We never leave his side for even a moment.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.909
How could we possibly rescue this Sada?

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.449
Complete nonsense.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:21.440
When you two fought with me
the night before,

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.110
one of you

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.320
was wounded by my Bi'an Sword

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.280
on the shoulder.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.960
We can verify the wound right now.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.320
If there's no wound,

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.710
I'll admit my crime and accept punishment.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.030
If there is a wound,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.590
it proves I'm telling the truth.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.230
Then please immediately tell me

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:35.710
where Sada is hiding.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.030
This seems quite reasonable.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.030
If you have nothing to hide,

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.290
why not remove your clothes and prove it?

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.000
Do you need

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.780
the Elite Constabulary Unit
to do it for you?

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.800
Wait.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:13.880
My Lord.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.090
Greetings, Marquis Jingshan.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.880
I find what you were just discussing

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.000
quite interesting.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.190
Blossom Skies,

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.690
corpse-sewing case...

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.450
Though I don't understand it all,

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.440
since the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.880
suspects someone from my household

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.440
is involved with the criminals,

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.800
then I cannot

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.400
remain uninvolved.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.080
Please forgive us, My Lord.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.530
These are merely
our subordinates' speculations.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.320
It's fine.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:46.030
My mansion

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.100
also values our reputation and dignity.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.080
Since this female constable

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.480
wants to see evidence,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.480
you two should remove your clothes

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.360
and let her see.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:58.800
Yes.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:24.550
You deliberately did this

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.550
to cover up evidence.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.590
We practice martial arts daily

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.630
to improve our skills.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.630
Injuries during sparring are inevitable,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.920
so having some wounds

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.230
is perfectly normal.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.070
Chief Fang, what do you think?

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.590
My Lord,

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.710
the wounds on their bodies

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.280
indeed don't count as evidence.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.670
Wait.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.150
Does this constable
have any other thoughts?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.890
I want to search
Marquis Jingshan's Mansion.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.510
I don't want to trouble you

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.280
over a small misunderstanding.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.140
After all, rumors can be damaging

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.150
and you care so much
about your reputation.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:04.670
If you have nothing to hide

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.800
and is certain this case
has nothing to do with your household,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.480
why not let us conduct a search?

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.280
Then if there are any rumors,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.710
the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:13.670
can also testify to your innocence.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.480
How dare you!

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:15.800
Do you think my mansion

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.800
can be searched at your whim?

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.840
It's not just the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.630
Without His Majesty's imperial decree,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.280
even the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.740
cannot act so recklessly.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.400
Zhong Xueman,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.800
stand down!

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.320
My Lord, if that's the case,

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.550
let me be clear.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.590
If this were just about Blossom Skies,

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.840
we certainly wouldn't dare to
trespass on your mansion.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.670
But this matter
has far-reaching implications

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:40.630
and may be connected to

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:42.070
the Yesha case from three years ago.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.340
The Yesha case is of great importance

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.230
to His Majesty.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.360
If the culprits escaped

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.840
because of your deliberate obstruction,

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.500
you wouldn't be able to handle

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.670
His Majesty's wrath easily

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.020
even if you were from the royal family,

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.420
let alone as a foreigner.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:55.950
I urge you to reconsider.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.510
Report!

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.440
My Lord,

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.630
terrible news, terrible news,

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.760
the Young Master...

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.290
What's the panic about?

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.280
I wonder if the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.280
might be able to help

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.360
the marquis now?

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.880
Is Ajia

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.900
in trouble again?

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.110
The Young Master has gone missing,

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.880
and there's blood in the courtyard.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.630
What?

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.030
Yitie,

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.920
take men to investigate
the back courtyard immediately.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.400
Yes.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.360
Hurry!

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:50.990
[Gentle Breeze Arrives]

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.600
Who was the last person
to see the Young Master?

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.760
It was me.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.880
I was the last to see
the Young Master last night.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.590
At that time, he was with several maids,

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:02.280
enjoying himself in the pavilion,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.400
and wouldn't let us in.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.590
This morning when I came

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.670
to serve the Young Master his meal,

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.670
I saw blood all over the floor

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.000
as soon as I entered,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.480
and the Young Master was gone.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.880
Bunch of useless fools!

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.480
Weren't you supposed to watch over him?

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.400
Go find him now!

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:14.930
Yes, sir.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:15.670
Yes, sir.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.150
My Lord.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.760
The criminals must have injured

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.440
the Young Master before taking him away.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.820
The Elite Constabulary Unit
needs to seal off

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.150
the entire Marquis Jingshan's Mansion

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:27.360
to see if we can find

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.550
any clues about his disappearance.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.510
Fine, I'll listen to you.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.400
Whatever methods
the Elite Constabulary Unit uses,

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.460
I don't care.

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:34.760
I just hope you'll do everything possible

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.710
to rescue my son.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.100
Rest assured, My Lord.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.100
Seal off Marquis Jingshan's Mansion!

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:39.590
Yes.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:40.550
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:41.550
Search thoroughly.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.230
Don't miss any corner.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.760
Report immediately if you find anything.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.320
Yes, sir.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:54.400
[Gentle Breeze Arrives]

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.670
I've already made inquiries.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:57.030
Young Master Ajia likes to spend time here

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.920
to indulge in pleasure,

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.110
and he also enjoys

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.480
playing hide-and-seek

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.880
with the maids here.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.670
Where are the maids?

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.960
They were all drugged unconscious.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.140
There were no other findings.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:07.960
Judging from the blood trail,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.960
Ajia must have been taken

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.800
from here.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.960
Not much blood. Likely non-fatal.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.500
I found something!

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:20.550
What did you find?

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.030
I discovered this piece of coarse cloth

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.550
on these thorny bushes.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.510
I suspect it was torn from the culprit's

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.110
pant cuff when they were abducting

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.190
Young Master Ajia and got caught

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.450
on these sharp thorns.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.400
It has a rusty smell.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.000
It also smells of salt.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.030
Therefore, I suspect

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.710
the culprit frequently visits a place

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.590
where large amounts

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:41.960
of salt and iron are stored.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.400
But ordinary households

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.660
all have salt and iron.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:46.150
These thorns are so low.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.440
The cloth must have been torn

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.100
from the culprit's pant cuff.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.440
Who would leave salt containers
and iron tools

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.840
scattered on the ground?

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.320
It's more likely a warehouse
storing salt and iron.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.480
In Qi Kingdom, salt and iron
are state-controlled.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.540
There's only one place in the capital

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.590
that would have a warehouse

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.630
storing such large quantities
of salt and iron.

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.430
