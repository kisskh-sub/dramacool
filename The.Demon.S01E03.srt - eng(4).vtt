00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.040
How long do we have to stay in this wretched place

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.519
anyway?

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.599
Hey, little brother.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:08.479
I just saved your life back there.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.479
Pretty impressive, right?

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.919
Thanks.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:15.280
Why do you look so spaced out?

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.599
Are you new here?

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.479
Yeah.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.800
Me too, I just arrived.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.520
I'm Rong Momo, a hamster demon.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.319
What about you?

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.360
My name's Jiang Li.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.240
I...

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.360
I guess I'm a...

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.919
Monkey.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.360
You're a human.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.840
The chief really is amazing.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.000
Even humans are allowed in the stronghold now.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.360
Since we're both new here,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.800
we should be friends.

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.840
Here, this is for you.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.080
It's super tasty.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.120
Do you know any magic?

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.039
No, I don't.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.280
That's okay.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.159
I'll look out for you from now on.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.639
I'm really strong.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.240
Sis.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.120
I made these pastries myself.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.159
Please try them.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.080
I've tried them, they're delicious.

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.240
So, what do you think?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.319
Can I join the kitchen staff now?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.800
Rong Momo.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.759
I can't take you in.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.639
You can't even cook a proper meal.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.240
Go cool off somewhere else.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.360
Just stay out of the way.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.000
Sis.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.719
Please take me in.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.520
You're the only family I have left.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.240
Shut up.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.719
Let me say this again.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:08.599
No one can know about our relationship.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.759
Don't let anyone find out.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.639
Chief.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.319
Momo.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.319
Why did you buy so many charcoal sticks again?

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.639
Just one would last a whole year.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.120
It's not that...

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.839
Chief.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:19.920
That Young Master Shen

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.639
asked me to bring your clothes over.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.600
Chief, your clothes.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.959
Why are your clothes with Young Master Shen?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.079
Is that right, Young Master Shen?

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.439
Enough.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.519
Rong Momo.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.040
I'll give you one more chance.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.560
Go find out

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.480
why that human is looking for the cat demon.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.600
Be subtle about it.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.120
Got it.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.040
Jiang Li, your Young Master

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.839
why is he searching for the cat demon?

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:49.120
That's his secret.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.720
I really can't say.

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.199
Humans are such trouble.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.879
Why so many

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:54.000
secrets anyway?

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.480
Are you mad?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.360
Of course I am.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.839
I treat you like a friend every day.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:58.639
But you always

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.000
keep things from me.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.399
Or maybe...

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.680
There's another way.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.279
Just tell me

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.519
as a little secret.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:21.360
Sorry.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.399
When it comes to Young Master,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.199
I really can't talk about it.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.439
Jiang Li.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.720
Young Master.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.079
Did you tell her everything?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.519
Of course not.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720
For Young Master's sake,

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.519
I even let Rong Momo down.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.600
Maybe...

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.279
What?

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.879
Maybe this is

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.879
a good chance to end the chaos caused by demons.

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.199
Young Master,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.040
but they're all demons.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.920
Even if we join forces,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.439
we're no match for them at all.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120
I know you're anxious.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.079
You want to solve the old city lord's worries.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.959
But I think

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:13.360
we can't just rush in like this.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.920
Why don't we escape first

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.279
and make a plan later?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.360
It's not difficult.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.480
As long as Fan Dayao is on our side,

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:25.439
that tiger demon,

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.279
she will listen to us.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.439
She's a cat.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.160
Young Master Shen,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.279
your power is innate.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.839
It's not some strange illness.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.360
It's because in your previous life,

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.959
you were entangled with a cat demon.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.120
Its demon core remained inside your body.

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:51.319
A human body carrying this demon core

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.800
uses up much more energy.

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.040
So at twenty-five,

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.079
you already have

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.279
the body of a sixty-year-old.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.959
If you don't return the demon core,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.240
you won't live much longer.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:11.519
Find the cat demon and return the core.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:12.839
How do I return it?

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.519
I only know the solution

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.639
is within this necklace.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.959
The secret inside

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.160
is something you must discover yourself.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.160
No wonder you're so powerful.

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.439
Then we need to quickly find

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.680
a way to return the demon core.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.519
Fan Dayao is eccentric

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.519
and ruthless.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.319
If we return it now,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.800
the people might suffer.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.240
We can't act recklessly.

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.399
We need a way to restrain her

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.759
before we act.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.920
That's true.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.319
She's a bully demon.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.920
If she gets any stronger,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.759
she could turn the world upside down.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.399
Young Master,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.399
but your body can't hold out much longer.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.839
Don't worry, I know my limits.

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:09.199
Let's go take a look.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.480
Xiao Jia has always been so careful.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.559
He was cautious in everything.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:00.480
Why would humans still

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:02.360
kill him so ruthlessly?

00:09:14.159 --> 00:09:14.960
Xiao Jia...

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.600
We promised each other

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.240
to train together

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.559
and become powerful demons.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.559
To stand side by side

00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:24.759
as the king's most trusted aides.

00:09:25.039 --> 00:09:26.440
To face life and death together.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:30.360
But now, only I am left, Xiao Jia.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.879
Xiao Jia...

00:09:35.879 --> 00:09:37.480
We will avenge you.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.200
Yes.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:40.840
We'll find the killer and avenge Xiao Jia.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.320
We'll find the killer and avenge Xiao Jia.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.720
We'll find the killer and avenge Xiao Jia.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.240
We'll find the killer and avenge Xiao Jia.

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.919
We'll find the killer and avenge Xiao Jia.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.759
Who?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.000
Fan Dayao, what are you doing?

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:28.320
I can't kill you.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.600
But I can still kill him, can't I?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.320
Stop!

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.960
My lord, please don't hurt him.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.360
He's not a bad person.

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:34.879
What do you know?

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.919
Get out of the way!

00:10:51.879 --> 00:10:52.679
My lord.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.000
Chief Fan.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.080
Let's talk.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.879
There's nothing to talk about with you.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.919
My lord.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.159
The situation isn't in our favor.

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.559
If we confront him directly,

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:07.759
we might not have the upper hand.

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:09.120
It's better to find out

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.879
what his intentions are first.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:10.840
Then decide what to do.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.080
Momo.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.360
Xiao Jia is my best friend.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.000
I hate humans.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.039
I hate Moyuan City.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:32.480
I'm sorry.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480
On behalf of those

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.879
humans who have hurt demons,

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.360
I apologize to you.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.759
It's not your fault.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.879
It's my own fault.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.840
It's because I couldn't

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.039
be as strong as the lord

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:50.840
and protect Xiao Jia.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.879
Momo.

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:56.200
I hope you can be happy.

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:58.440
Really.

00:12:09.559 --> 00:12:10.799
This has nothing to do with me.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.840
Do you think I'll believe that?

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.200
Can you tell me what happened?

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:20.759
Stop pretending.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.440
You're from Moyuan City.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:24.799
So what?

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:32.240
Don't tell me you don't know.

00:12:32.559 --> 00:12:33.679
For hundreds of years,

00:12:33.879 --> 00:12:35.000
your Moyuan City

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.960
has hunted demons to extinction.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.799
That's because some demons harm humans.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.120
We have to drive them out.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.840
Not all humans are as you think.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.240
And not all demons

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.600
are under your control.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.519
We just heard the wind chimes and found them pleasant,

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.679
so we wandered in by mistake.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.480
We meant no harm.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.080
Those aren't wind chimes.

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:00.840
They're lives.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:04.360
Lives taken by humans.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.720
Hundreds of lives.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.600
Every wind chime here

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.120
contains

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.320
the spirit essence of a little demon.

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.039
I saved the pangolin

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:36.720
from the jaws of humans.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:39.120
Its power was weak,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.759
but to repay me,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.759
it always watched out carefully

00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:43.799
and kept guard for me.

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.320
It never hurt anyone.

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.080
But it still couldn't escape

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.320
human hunters.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.720
They insisted it was

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.360
an evil demon.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.840
They skinned and tortured it.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.879
When I found it,

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.840
it was already covered in wounds.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.000
I could only

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
protect its last trace of spirit essence.

00:14:05.159 --> 00:14:06.080
Demons kill humans.

00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.720
Humans fear them.

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:08.840
That's why they fight back.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.519
What's the difference between demons and humans?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.279
If one demon does evil,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.639
does that mean all demons should be killed?

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.080
You call me cruel.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:20.840
What about humans?

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.759
Aren't you a hundred times more cruel?

00:14:23.159 --> 00:14:23.759
Fine.

00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:26.200
I'll make them pay the price they deserve.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.279
Shen Wangchen.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:33.639
I'm warning you.

00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:35.440
Don't even think about our demon stronghold.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.519
You have supernatural power.

00:14:38.039 --> 00:14:39.559
I can't touch you right now.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:41.120
But your little followers

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:42.879
and all your people in the city

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.279
might not be so lucky.
