00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.310
Next,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.270
we need to locate

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.150
where Yellow Heaven conducts
their Heaven's Roar ritual

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.510
to flush out those higher-level followers

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.270

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.340
then use them to find the Holy Master.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.270
But how do we investigate this?

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.270
The Heaven's Roar ritual requires
blood from living humans.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.980
Something this inhumane

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.460
will certainly be conducted
in secret by Yellow Heaven.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.270
This might be even harder to investigate

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.670
than their corpse refinement operations.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.830
Even the followers of Earth's Whisper
don't know

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.310
where the followers of Heaven's Roar are,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.460
let alone us.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.950
It seems we're really

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.900
in trouble now.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.270
As long as they've committed crimes,

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.200
they must have left traces behind.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.630
The followers of Heaven's Roar

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.270
must have left clues we can follow.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.070
That's right.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.750
You can't hide the truth forever.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.390
If Yellow Heaven
is harvesting human blood,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.580
they can't possibly leave nothing behind.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.870
Let's investigate if there have been

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.300
any strange occurrences
in Weizhou recently.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.760
We should find some leads.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.530
Xueman and I will handle this.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.870
Then what can I do?

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.020
Yellow Heaven's blood harvesting

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.510
must involve some medicinal techniques.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.020
You should start from that angle.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.830
Miss Huo is quite clever.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.900
The two of you working together

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.340
will be twice as effective.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.150
What about me?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.830
You don't need to do anything.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.270
Just stay here and watch those two people.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.270
How can that work?

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.870
I know Weizhou better than anyone.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.340
If I don't go looking for clues,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.100
then who will?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.830
Exactly.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.660
It's precisely because
you know Weizhou so well

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.070
that we can't let you go.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.660
You're a constable.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.070
You should understand that investigating

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.270
requires secrecy.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.710
Right now, everyone in Weizhou City

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.190
knows that you,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.020
the Third Young Master of the Tong family,
have returned.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.350
If we alert our targets,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.840
our task will become even more difficult.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.610
So I'm making things
more difficult for you?

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:24.660
Fine.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.660
Then, I'll go right now

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.710
and break their legs.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.310
Then things won't be
difficult for you, right?

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.510

Lately,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.540
you've completely
lost control of yourself,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.870
acting recklessly several times

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.460
and nearly causing a disaster.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.510
That night with the haunted escort wagon,

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.980
you disobeyed orders
and acted on your own,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.220
getting yourself surrounded.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.830
If Xueman hadn't

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:47.980
broken those lanterns in time,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.780
you'd probably be injured

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.180
and bedridden right now!

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.100
During yesterday's exchange,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.220
you didn't follow the plan.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.100
You almost got Feng Qingzhuo

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.560
killed by those villains.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.310
During the interrogation,

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.390
you lost your temper and attacked them.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.580
If we hadn't stopped you in time,

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.150
you would have

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.750
beaten those two men to death.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.390
Not only have we lost

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.340

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.350
Still thinking about Tong Shuang?

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.390
Tong Shuang is from Weizhou.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.350
And now we're staying
at the Pingyuan Escort Agency,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.950
where everything around him

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.300
reminds him of the past.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.870
Dozens of people

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.110
died in a single night.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.560
No one can remain unmoved by that,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.990
or feel nothing at all.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.780
Fire! Fire!

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:15.700
Help!

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.020
Quick! We need water!

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:17.990
Fire!

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.270
More water!

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.290
Help!

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.820
So it's normal that he lost control

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.390
and made some mistakes.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.520
The way you spoke to him this morning

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.450
probably made him feel even worse.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.350
I understand him.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.660
But for what we're doing now,

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.540
we can't tolerate
even the slightest mistake.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.270
Yes, we need to avoid mistakes,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.870
but is keeping him out of the plan

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.330
really the best solution?

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.710
Telling him to calm down

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.390
doesn't mean he can.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.160
I especially understand

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.960
how Tong Shuang feels right now.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.300
Because

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.300
I've been through it too.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.820
Xueman.

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.640
After the Fengbo Lake tragedy,

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.060
I tried countless times

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.660
to bury my hatred for you

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.420
and be a normal person.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:16.700
But the truth is that

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.890
anger doesn't just disappear.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:21.990
It only makes the pain worse.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.510
Sometimes, letting out

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.780
those bottled-up emotions

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:30.900
might be better.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.240
Go check on him.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.110
Leave the investigation to me.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.070
I don't quite understand

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:41.670
the bond between you men.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.400
But I know he needs you

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.110
more than I do right now.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.570
Third Young Master, you must be hungry.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.740
I'll go to the kitchen
and get you something to eat.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.790
Young Master Tong!

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.580

Slow down!

Young Master, I...

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.540
I told you all to go away!

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.300
Quickly leave.

they...

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.870
Mr. Hai, close the door.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:31.340
Stop right there!

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.300
What is this?

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.160
Young Master Tong,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.420
I don't have anything valuable at home.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.020
I just have some millet left.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.650
We've come to apologize.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.890
The officials told us

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.410
about the grave robbers.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.490

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.690
offer our apologies.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:50.820
Yes, Young Master Tong.

Before the Pingyuan
Escort Agency's tragedy,

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:53.850
the poor people of Weizhou,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.460
those with family hardships,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.660
all received help from the Tong family.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.460
Back when we couldn't afford to eat,

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.310
it was Old Master Tong

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.580
who gave our family a bag of rice,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.980
saving my entire family.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.050
We were cowards

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.340
and ungrateful for your kindness.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.130
Young Master Tong,

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.340
please accept these gifts

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:09.700
to ease our conscience.

Yes, Young Master Tong.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.870
These items

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:13.470
may not be worth much,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.180
but they represent

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.170
our sincere gratitude.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:17.220
Please don't refuse them.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.700
Yes.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.630
Please accept them, Young Master.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.700
Yes, Young Master Tong.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.850
Please accept them.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.540
Take them, Young Master Tong.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.740
Please accept them, Young Master Tong.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.320

he'll be comforted.

Thank you.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:06.820

we'd like to buy some medicinal herbs.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.470
Yes, of course.

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.550
Please have a seat.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.370
What kind of medicine do you need?

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.440
We'd like to buy some

medicine to nourish blood and energy.

Nourishing medicine?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.300
Anything like ginseng
and codonopsis would do.

We've just been

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.340
to several pharmacies,

I don't have any either.

I'm afraid there's none left
in all of Weizhou City.

How can that be?

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.520
Surely not everyone

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.850
in the city needs to nourish their blood?

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:03.970
There are no herbs available.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.420
Don't ask about anything else.

my husband is severely injured.

If I can't find

medicine to replenish his blood,

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.540

where to get blood-nourishing medicine.

Take him away quickly.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.770
if he dies here,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.280
it'll ruin my reputation.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.650
No rush. Eat slowly.

You've reached the Qi Kingdom territory

No.

I want to repay your kindness.

I don't need your gratitude.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.020
Hurry into town

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.260
and find someone to treat your leg.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.500
Otherwise, you'll have a limp.

I want to follow you.

Why is it you again?

you have some martial arts skills

and determination.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.930
Why not do something

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.330
other than following me?

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.670
My father taught me that

even the smallest kindness
deserves great gratitude.

You saved my life.

to repay you,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.340
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.020
But if I stay by your side,

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.500
I'll be able to
repay your kindness someday.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.020
Why are you so stubborn?

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.340

I'll kill you.

of my life.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:18.940
Even at a time like this,

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.620
he's still thinking about
the investigation.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:22.800
He said before

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:26.250
that to die on the path of justice

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.410
is his destiny.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.170
[Escort]

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.410
Tong Shuang!

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:36.580
Tong Shuang, where are you going?

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.340
To find Old Bug.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:37.930
What for?

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.370
He knows how to cure the poison.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.130
Stop being ridiculous.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:41.300
You stop it!

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.210
Beiming is already in this state.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.610
He's running out of time.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.020
I know you're worried.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:48.900
I'm even more worried than you.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.650
But can you find Old Bug now?

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.820
Will you make it in time?

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.610
Then tell me what to do!

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.060
Should we just stand by

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.410
and watch Beiming die?

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.610
Tong Shuang.

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.210
At a time like this,

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:03.820
don't make Beiming

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:05.220
worry about you anymore.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.450
He treats you like his own brother.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.380
Right now,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.410
you should stay by his side.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:16.950
How many days left?

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.450
The one-month deadline

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.690
is already half over.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.980
-Xueman, I...
-I know.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.070
I understand everything.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.300
You are my senior,

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.210
but you're also a constable
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:39.910
I know you have

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.510
things you must do.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.680
Let's discuss the case first.

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.850
Everyone,

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.580
report what clues you've found.

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.820
Beiming, you're in this condition...

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.580
Coroner Feng and I

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.500
visited all the pharmacies

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.350
and clinics in Weizhou today.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.260
Nothing seemed unusual,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.130
except that all blood-nourishing tonics

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.340
are completely sold out.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.520
I don't have any either.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.930
I'm afraid there's none left
in all of Weizhou City.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.020
It seems a mysterious wealthy merchant

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:23.950
bought them all.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.250
Xueman,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.170
what did you find out?

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.580
I spent the day
talking with

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.610
idlers at teahouses and customers

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:30.650
at Yangchun House.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:31.650
From what I heard,

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.650
there's indeed something
strange recently.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.580
Adopting sons to care for elderly parents.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.610
A group of wealthy merchants

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.650
recently arrived in Weizhou.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:38.850
They have no children,

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.610
but they want to adopt strong young men

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:41.260
who are filial

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.170
and whose parents have passed away.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:44.690
These adopted sons
will serve their adoptive parents,

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.020
and when the adoptive parents pass away,

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.820
they will inherit their wealth.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.580
I also found out they've recently

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.170
rented the Salt Business Guild

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:52.740
to recruit these adopted sons.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.820
The selection criteria
are reportedly very strict.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.820
Those with family

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.170
or living parents

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.540
are rejected outright.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.260
So those coming to offer filial piety

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.260
are mostly ruffians and beggars.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.100
Oh,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.690
that merchant who bought all the tonics

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:08.090
is also staying at
the Salt Business Guild.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.300
Yellow Heaven needs to collect
large amounts of fresh human blood,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.450
and now all blood-nourishing tonics

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.820
have been bought up.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.650
Everything points to
the Salt Business Guild too.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.580
It's very likely

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.780
that Yellow Heaven is
keeping people captive

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.780
and improving their blood quality first.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:24.130
When the time is right,

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:26.830
they'll extract their blood
for the ritual.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:28.170
So those people are...

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.460
This adoption scheme

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:30.500
is very likely

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.760
Yellow Heaven's trap.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:34.700
Luring people with promises of wealth...

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.850
Tricking them into going there,

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.580
and then killing them for their blood.

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.540
Most who go there

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.060
are parentless ruffians and beggars.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.650
Even if they disappear or die,

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.300
no one will report it.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:49.850
What should we do next?

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.850
The best approach now

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.850
is for someone to pose as an adopted son

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:56.850
and infiltrate the Salt Business Guild
to investigate.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:57.540
I'll go.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.500
No,

00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:59.980
you're from Weizhou.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.740
You'll definitely be recognized.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.540
I'll go then.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.020
I can disguise myself as a man.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.480
The situation inside is unclear.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.610
A woman disguised as a man
can be easily discovered.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.410
I'll go.

00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:13.370
No way.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.060
Your martial skills are too poor.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.060
If you're discovered,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.370
you'll barely be able to protect yourself.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.370
You're too timid.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.980
If you're exposed,
it'll be even more troublesome.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.740
My martial arts skills aren't great,

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.610
but I'm just going to
pretend to be an adopted son,

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.540
not to commit aggravated robbery.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:27.820
Compared to you,

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.170
I might be a bit less brave

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.980
and not bold enough
for fighting and killing,

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.210
but it's definitely enough

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:33.410
for sneaking around.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.270
Don't worry.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.690
Besides, for this mission to succeed,

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:38.350
it requires meticulousness.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.340
I'm a coroner.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.400
No one is more meticulous than me.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.420
No one is more suitable than me.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.780
Beiming.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.740
I'll go.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.780
Then let's do

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.240
as Coroner Feng suggests.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.030
Dairong,

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.980
please help Coroner Feng

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.110
cover up his wounds.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:11.910
Tong Shuang,

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.540
go scout the Salt Business Guild.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.410
See if there are any

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:15.670
suitable places around it for an ambush.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.170
In case something really happens,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.020
we need to be able

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.020
to rush in and save him immediately.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:28.840
You all go ahead without worry.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.850
What you're doing now

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.260
is more effective for me

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.610
than any cure in this world.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:40.100
I'll wait here for your return.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.020
Beiming.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:42.340
Tong Shuang.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.100
I believe in you.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.170
Okay.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.130
Coroner Feng.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.640
Don't overthink things.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:58.230
We're here with you.

00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:59.780
Don't be afraid.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.860
What do I have to be afraid of?

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.700
I'm only afraid

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.300
I won't have the chance

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.700
to do more things for you.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.980
I'll go now.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.610
Beiming.

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:37.850
I think Old Bug

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.120
was just exaggerating

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.180
so he could escape.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.190
You don't just have one month left,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.980
so rest easy and focus on recovery.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.840
I've already instructed Mr. Hai.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.260
If you still feel cold,

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.200
he'll bring you another brazier.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.790
Please don't waste your energy worrying.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.380
