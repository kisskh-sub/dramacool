Who's there?

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.520
Save him first. Let's go!

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.240
Save him!

Coroner Feng!

Hang in there.

Coroner Feng.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.230
Heaven has been kind to me,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.660
allowing me to see you one last time
before I die.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.320
Don't talk nonsense.

You're going to be fine.

how do you want to handle
these scoundrels?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.560
That leader

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.870
is a key criminal wanted by
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.160
We'd like to interrogate him separately.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.870
That's right.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.430
As for the others,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:02.280

What should we do?

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.950
Is there really no way to save him?

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.159
I've got nothing.

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:54.950
Indeed.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So young,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.750
yet with so little time left.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.830
What a pity.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.000
Hey, you've been discussing for so long.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.870
Have you figured anything out yet?

If you have, then hurry up and save him.

and his pulse is weak.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.430
I'm afraid we can't save him.

That's right.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.430
Better start preparing for the inevitable.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.270
Aren't you supposed to be expert doctors?

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.920
You can't even treat such a minor ailment?

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.410
There's truly nothing we can do.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:30.750
Even if you kill us,
it won't change anything.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.870
At this point,
even the best doctor in the world

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.630
couldn't save him.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.510
That's right.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.309
Better prepare for the funeral.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.169
Who said that?

Grab a pen.

This...

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.510
-Here.
-Give it to me.

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:53.860
Write down the prescription.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.750
-Alright.
-I'll write it down.

Two qian of deer antler herb.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.110
Two qian of deer antler herb.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.510
Three qian of saffron.

Ginseng slices.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.870
Two qian of codonopsis,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.530
and four qian of dragon whisker herb.
That should be enough.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.510
Did you get all that?

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.150
This is

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.630
quite unusual, this prescription.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:20.360
Indeed.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.960
What are you questioning?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.720
Just do as I say.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.180
Boil three bowls of water down to one.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.270
Consider this prescription my gift to you.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.510
Doctors,

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.840
please prepare the medicine

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.720
according to his prescription.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.910
-Got it.
-I'll go with you.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.600
Okay.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.630
Hurry up.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:40.630
Come on.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.440
Madman.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.850
How are you feeling?

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.820
Would you like some water?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.750
I knew

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.630
you could save my life.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.150
Without you risking your life and bleeding
to mark the way,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.280
we wouldn't have found Yellow Heaven.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.150
As long as you caught him.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.910
That's all that matters.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.840
I need to rest for a while.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.320
W-Wait a moment.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.330
Papa Feng.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.750
What did you say?

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.600
I said, Papa Feng.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480
It's all my fault.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.150
It's all my fault for arriving too late

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.550
that you bled so much

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.150
and almost died.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.670
But I made a vow

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.270
that as long as you survive this,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.200
I'll call you Papa Feng from now on.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.440
Say it again.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:48.360
Say it again.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.240
Papa wants to hear it.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.980
Listen carefully.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.750
Madman!

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.250
That's enough.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.240
Let him have a good rest.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.840
We'll step outside.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.510
Go to sleep.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:22.960
So you're Yesha.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.440
What does Yesha

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.440
have to do with me?

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.080
You know Old Bug, don't you?

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.480
He told us

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.030
everything about you.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.840
And who is Old Bug?

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.630
I don't know him.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.080
Then explain to me

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.410
what the red crystal is all about.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.270
If you don't know Old Bug,

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:47.440
how would you know

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.750
how to refine it?

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.720
Red crystal?

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.360
And what on earth is red crystal?

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.960
I'll ask you one last time,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.600
where is Yesha?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.270
Come closer.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.120
I'll whisper it to you.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
Yesha

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.510
is Xiao Beiming.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.030
It's all Xiao Beiming's orders.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.940
Everyone under heaven knows that

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.910
Yesha is Xiao Beiming.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.240
I am indeed Xiao Beiming's subordinate.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.510
All my actions,

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.670
as well as
the entire Yellow Heaven's actions,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.750
are all under Xiao Beiming's orders.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.150
You asked me to tell you,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.510
and I told you honestly,

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.470
but you wouldn't believe me.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.490
Why is that?

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.510
You killed so many people

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.270
just to refine red crystal.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.550
What was it all for?

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.850
Nothing special.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.150
Just a personal preference.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.650
What do you mean?

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:06.390
I mean

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:09.600
it was for fun.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:12.360
Do you know

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.150
what the most pleasant sound

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.150
in this world is?

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.150
It's the sound a person makes
right before they die.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.720
It's truly delightful.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.280
From the begging

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.850
and pleading at the start,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.080
to the crying

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.270
screaming,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:32.750
and then finally

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.270
growing weaker

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:37.480
and weaker,

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.080
until there's no sound at all.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.150
It's like hundreds of ants

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.840
crawling all over your body.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.270
Truly beautiful.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.630
Whether it's red crystal or not,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.480
it doesn't matter to me.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.670
What matters is

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.320
I enjoy watching them suffer.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.080
Bad news.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.320
Urgent message
from the Ministry of Justice.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.320
We must escort Huang Wuchang
back to the capital for trial immediately.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.960
You're awake.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.090
How are you feeling?

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.080
Miss Huo.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.630
Don't worry.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.010
With my prescription,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.750
I could even bring back someone

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.480
who's halfway in the grave.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:43.730
Alright, alright.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.230
You're the greatest.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.120
Don't move around.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.450
I'll get your medicine.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.030
Where's Beiming?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.750
How is he?

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.840
Is he alright?

00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:58.720
He's alright.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.700
I know what you're worried about.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.520
But you've lost too much blood,

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.670
and your wounds haven't healed yet.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.450
You need to take care of yourself first

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.150
before you can help him, right?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.810
Don't move. Stay still.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.910
No big deal.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.790
I've just been lying down

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:16.960
for too long

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.800
and wanted to sit up for a bit.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.270
Thanks.

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.270
Be careful.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.120
I can manage on my own.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.790
Don't move.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.720
Here.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.080
Miss Huo.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:02.840
I...

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.480
What I wanted to say is that...

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.870
I'm deeply grateful for your kindness

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.270
and will never forget it.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.960
Is gratitude all

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.080
you have to say to me?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.030
No.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:22.880
That's not what I meant.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.840
Actually, I wanted to say...

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.550
T-Thanks.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:33.720
You were actually a sweeter talker

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:35.250
when you were unconscious.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.360
Unconscious?

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.150
What did I say when I was unconscious?

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.030
Nothing much,

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.370
just that you're a coward.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.510
A coward?

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.060
Take your medicine first.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.819
The Ministry of Justice has sent orders

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.220
to the Weizhou Garrison.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.839
Wang Feihu will send people to escort you.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.510
Your condition can't wait any longer.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.589
You must go back quickly

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.720
and find Old Bug.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.970
I can still tough it out.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.880
Is Huang Wuchang still

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.960
not talking?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.640
I've tried everything.

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.069
But fortunately,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:28.960
although he identified

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.160
Xiao Beiming as Yesha,

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.560
he didn't recognize you.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.510
Now that he's been captured,

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.750
once we return to the capital,

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:35.440
we'll find a way

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.510
to make him talk.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:39.640
Whether Huang Wuchang is Yesha

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.030
still needs to be verified.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.030
They previously refined
a large amount of red crystal,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.880
and we still don't know
what they used it for.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.480
There are still many

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.240
Yellow Heaven remnants at large.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.910
I'm afraid this matter

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:49.570
won't be resolved so quickly.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.200
I'll have the Weizhou Garrison
closely monitor

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.510
the movements of
the Yellow Heaven remnants

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.350
and report immediately
if there's any news.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.720
We're the ones who caught him.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.440
As long as I convince
the Ministry of Justice after we return

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.070
to let me interrogate Huang Wuchang,

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.330
everything will still be under control.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.550
That's not right.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.480
What's wrong?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.000
Huang Wuchang is of great significance.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.790
Wang Feihu would definitely

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.200
report it to the Ministry of Justice.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.440
But the Ministry of Justice's response

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.510
came too quickly.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.830
The round trip

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.570
would take at least two or three days.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.200
Why did we receive
the Ministry of Justice's orders

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.400
right after we started interrogating?

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.530
Before we made the arrest,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.960
someone had already guessed the outcome

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.480
and reported it
to the Ministry of Justice.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.680
How is that possible?

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.310
Looks like trouble has come sooner
than expected.

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.160
Don't worry.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.480
We'll deal with whatever comes our way.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.610
We'll set off early tomorrow morning.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.440
We're escorting a key criminal,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.880
so everyone, stay alert!

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.750
Constable Zhong.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.400
The distance from Weizhou to the capital

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.200
is quite long.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.110
I can only

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.290
escort you this far.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.510
Thank you for your help and care

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.960
these past few days, Constable Wang.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.070
No need to thank me.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:01.770
It's just what I should do.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.510
But there's something I wanted to...

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.440
Constable Wang.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:06.070
We've fought side by side,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.360
so just speak freely.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.920
In the case of eliminating Yellow Heaven,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.310
the Elite Constabulary Unit
deserves the main credit,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.870
but my men of the Weizhou Garrison

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.870
also contributed their fair share.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.310
Some of my men

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.750
are still recovering from their wounds
at home.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:22.550
I wonder

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.020
if, when you return to the capital

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.070
and meet the officials
at the Ministry of Justice,

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.370
you could put in a good word

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.970
for my men, Constable Zhong?

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.510
Of course I will.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.050
If it weren't for you, Constable Wang,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.640
and your men arriving in time,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.160
let alone capturing Huang Wuchang,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.720
we all

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.200
would have lost our lives.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.970
Thanks a lot, Constable Zhong.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.270
So,

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.160
as for the favor I asked of you,
Constable Wang...

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.070
Please rest assured.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.310
Whenever I come across
any remnants of Yellow Heaven,

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.000
I'll arrest

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.560
every single one of them.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.480
My Lord, someone's blocking our way.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.210
Who would dare to block our way?

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:02.240
Could it be the remnants of Yellow Heaven?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.170
They look like government troops.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.830
Aren't we government troops ourselves?

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.830
No, it's not that.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.050
Those people are...

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.160
Zhuge Kongyun?

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:23.050
I'm Zhuge Kongyun
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.000
I'm here under orders

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.530
to escort the key criminal,
Huang Wuchang, back to the capital.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.540
Young Master.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.790
Coroner Feng's signing up as a sworn son?

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.050
What's this all about?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.750
Do you want me to disguise myself
and sneak in

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:50.640
to check it out?

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:51.960
No need.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.200
Go send a secret message to the unit

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.130
and request additional manpower.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.260
Yes, Young Master.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.480
Xiao Beiming.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.510
The game has begun.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.310
Zhuge Kongyun.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160
The Yellow Heaven cult

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.880
was eliminated by
our Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.860
and their leader Huang Wuchang

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.920
was captured by us.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.350
Weizhou is not the capital,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.440
and this is not a major case,
so there's no need

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.750
for the Secret Investigation Unit
to interfere.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.920
I'm not trying to steal

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.550
the Elite Constabulary Unit's credit,

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.480
nor do I care about
the Yellow Heaven cult.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.140
I'm only here to ask one thing:

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.310
is the key criminal, Huang Wuchang,

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.310
connected to Yesha or not?

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.150
To be honest,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.310
I didn't want to

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.680
make this trip to Weizhou

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.070
and go through all this trouble.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.670
But I received intelligence

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.720
indicating that

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.070
the Yellow Heaven cult

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.960
is likely connected to Yesha.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Don't forget that

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.350
the Yesha case

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.080
is still under the jurisdiction of
our Secret Investigation Unit.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.470
Constable Zhong,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.440
we've worked on cases together before,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.960
but you've repeatedly been dishonest

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.480
and played games with me.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.240
To prevent further misunderstandings
between us,

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.920
I specifically reported to
the Ministry of Justice

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.850
and obtained official documents.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.900
The documents clearly state

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:10.720
that the key criminal,
Huang Wuchang,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.570
is to be handed over to
our Secret Investigation Unit.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.190
[Ministry of Justice Permit]

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.030
Zhuge Kongyun.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.540
How do you prove

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.310
that the key criminal
is connected to Yesha?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.400
It's simple.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.030
I'll know right after interrogation.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.960
If you refuse to hand over
the key criminal

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.490
and defy orders from above,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.750
the consequences...

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.200
What if your interrogation reveals

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.310
the suspect has no connection to Yesha?

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.720
False reporting of case details

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.320
will surely be dealt with
according to the law.

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:42.770
Constable Zhong, you're a smart person.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960
Rather than returning to the capital

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.270
and risking execution,

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.400
you might as well hand
the key criminal over to me

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.730
and see if I'll be the one

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.670
being executed instead.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.270
Take your criminal

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.070
and leave now.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.400
Constable Zhong,
you truly understand what's at stake.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.240
Thanks a lot.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:14.240
Take him away.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.000
Farewell.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.680
Hold on.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.790
I've handed the criminal over to you.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.000
What else do you want?

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.920
I heard that Coroner Feng and Miss Huo

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.400
have also come to Weizhou.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.240
They're in the carriage, right?

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.750
Since we've all met before,

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.680
I'd better go over

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.680
and say hello.

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.190
That won't be necessary.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.810
Just keep your men in line.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.720
Proper etiquette

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.730
should still be observed.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.270
I just remembered something.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.770
I heard that Coroner Feng

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.400
nearly lost his life a few days ago
while working on this case in Weizhou.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:52.480
Since Miss Huo

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.310
is in the carriage taking care of him,

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.350
I won't disturb them further.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:04.790
Mr. Zhuge.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.640
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.480
Sorry for my poor manners.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:12.680
Get well soon.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.370
What exactly is Zhuge Kongyun

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.920
up to?

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.360
Whatever he's planning,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.830
fortunately, he didn't lift the curtain,

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.240
or we'd be in big trouble.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480
Thank goodness,

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.200
we dodged a bullet.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.580
Fortunately, this Zhuge fellow

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.720
knows when to back off.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.310
I already had my blade out.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.150
If he dared to lift that curtain,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.960
I would've chopped his hand off.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.510
It's not that simple.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.240
What do you mean?

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.910
From his choice of words,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.310
I'm afraid he already knows

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:15.440
about my presence.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.550
Perhaps he's been

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:18.880
in Weizhou for some time,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.640
watching us from the shadows.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.310
Then hasn't your cover been blown?

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.830
I can't figure it out either.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:25.240
Taking away a minor henchman,
Huang Wuchang,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.070
should be nothing compared to

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.720
capturing me, Yesha, myself.

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.790
If he had already discovered

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:29.590
my presence,

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.450
why didn't he make a move just now?

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:34.110
Could it be that he hadn't discovered you?

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.910
That's right.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:35.980
He might not have guessed

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.110
that you're with us.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.030
Let's hope so.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.520
Young Master.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.680
There must be something suspicious
about that carriage.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.110
When you passed by the carriage,

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:49.200
Zhong Xueman's expression

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.400
was clearly nervous.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.510
I noticed

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.610
she was about to draw her Bi'an Sword.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.820
Of course I know something's off.

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.160
Then why didn't you

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.200
expose them just now, Young Master?

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.920
Their performance isn't over yet.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.720
Exposing them now

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.720
would spoil the fun.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.750
Might as well

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.000
let them continue

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.450
with their little show.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:11.550
I've finally figured out

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.110
the key to the Yesha case.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.940
Since the Secret Investigation Unit

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.340
took over the Yesha case,

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.160
we've actually

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.750
fallen into a misconception.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.330
That is,

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.480
we've been following the case all along.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.810
What's wrong with that?

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.110
For dealing with ordinary criminals,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.920
that's fine.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.590
But when dealing with Xiao Beiming,

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:27.920
it's a grave mistake.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.030
I've been competing with Xiao Beiming
for years.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.670
I believe my deductive abilities

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:32.680
are no worse than his,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.790
yet I'm always one step behind,

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.920
half a beat too slow.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.820
That's because there's one thing

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.110
I'm truly not as good at as he is.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.750
What is it?

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.480
This is a gamble to start with.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.550
Wanna bet?

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:45.070
If you lose this time,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.920
you'll be doomed.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.500
You've known me for years.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.210
Have you ever seen me lose?

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.700
Do you know why you've never

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.700
been able to beat me all these years?

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:59.510
I'm not as willing to take risks as he is.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:00.490
We thought

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.110
he would hide from us

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.750
like a mouse from a cat.

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.480
But in reality, this gambler

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.700
has never considered himself

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:06.550
as the mouse.

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:08.310
Instead, he sees himself as the hunter.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.920
We thought we were hunting him,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.830
but in reality,

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:11.680
we've been led

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.750
by the nose all along.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:14.070
This is why we've always

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.310
failed to catch him.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.920
Are you suggesting

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.750
he's been around us all this time?

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.270
If he wants to keep leading us on,

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:24.110
then I'll

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.440
follow the rope right to him
and catch him.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.480
If well played,

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.200
it's going to be

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.550
a show that will shock the world.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:40.550
Xueman.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.030
I've always been curious about something.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.350
Why do you dislike

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.510
Mr. Zhuge so much?

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.510
After all,

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.720
he's as renowned as Beiming,

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.790
both elite investigators of Qi Kingdom.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.680
Is it just because of the rivalry

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.030
between the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit?

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:53.790
But you don't seem like

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.480
someone who would care about such things.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.550
I just resent him.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.680
I've always found him annoying.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.110
A grown man always dressing up

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.920
all flashy and showy.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:02.830
Beiming.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.400
If you hadn't stopped me from
beating him up,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.240
I would've taught him a lesson long ago.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.030
The three of us have known each other
since childhood.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.440
I remember Xueman used to

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.160
beat Zhuge Kongyun up when we were little.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.160
Why was that?

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.890
This Zhuge Kongyun

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.160
may be a bit eccentric,

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.920
but he doesn't seem like a bad guy.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.310
It's all just a facade.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.680
He's been ruthless since childhood,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.240
dabbling in all sorts of shady practices.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.030
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.170
I remember a few years ago,

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.720
there was a serial murder case,

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.510
and to lure out the killer,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.590
he used the victim as bait.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.310
But that victim

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.790
was just

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.160
a teenage girl.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.540
He did catch the killer in the end,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.750
but that kid

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:41.550
developed hysteria from the trauma

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:42.750
and became a recluse.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.750
Someone like him

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.030
only thinks about himself.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.110
His methods of solving cases

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.720
have no moral boundaries, either.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.590
You're too arrogant in handling cases.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.420
I'm afraid you'll eventually

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.680
pay for your arrogance one day.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.880
In life, one wrong step

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.590
often leads to many more.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.160
I don't want you to go astray

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.220
and regret it in the future, you know?

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.000
You're too proud, even arrogant.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.640
You think of Yesha as a rival

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.070
to play the game with,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.240
but his real purpose

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.510
is not to defeat you.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.510
You seem to get the upper hand now,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.880
but how do you know

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.750
he has no backup plan?

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.880
And how do you know

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.750
whether he's deliberately

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.610
letting you gain this advantage?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.820
We are the same kind of person.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.180
You two are nothing alike.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.030
I've made the same mistakes.

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.310
People like us

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:28.680
unconsciously put ourselves

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.960
in positions where we can control

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.420
others' lives and deaths.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.170
But only by making mistakes

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.780
do we learn where to draw the line.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.790
Zhuge Kongyun isn't inherently bad.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.030
He just cares about things

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.400
that are different from what others value.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.160
What he cares about

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.360
doesn't matter to me.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.090
But about Huang Wuchang,

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.750
we can't let his off so easily.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.390
Once we get back to the capital

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.730
and cure your illness,

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.800
I'll settle the score with him.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.240
Tong Shuang.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.440
Go faster.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.400
Got it, Beiming.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.310
Such a large forest,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:33.880
yet not even a bird's call can be heard.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.680
Indeed.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:37.800
Watch out.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:39.680
Keep an eye on Huang Wuchang.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.160
Yes.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.400
Danger! It's an ambush!

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.210
This smoke is poisonous...

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.640
Here.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.510
Xueman.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:11.790
You can't stay here.

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.630
The Elite Constabulary Unit
must already know

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:13.480
that Huang Wuchang and you

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.240
have returned to the capital.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.590
If you don't go to
the Elite Constabulary Unit to report,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.250
Fang Tianzheng will definitely
be suspicious.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.920
They are all here

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920
taking care of me.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:23.880
Don't worry.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.480
If you keep staying here

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.200
and Fang Tianzheng becomes suspicious,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.400
things will get even more complicated.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.080
Tong Shuang.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.270
Go find out

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.790
if Old Bug has shown up recently.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.160
This is the most urgent matter right now.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.760
Alright, I'll go right away.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.270
Coroner Feng, your injuries...

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.790
Don't worry, I'm okay.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.480
I'll prepare some medicine
as soon as possible

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.750
to ease Beiming's pain

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.070
and buy as much time as we can.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.920
Don't worry.

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:55.830
We'll take good care of Beiming.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.070
Zhong Xueman.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.880
I thought you had finally
made something of yourself,

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.760
that you could bring great merit
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.440
so we could finally redeem our reputation.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.500
But what happened?

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.510
The key criminal we went to such lengths
to capture

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.300
was snatched away by that sly fox
Zhuge Kongyun

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.830
right from under our noses.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:18.790
If you had

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.640
sent me word earlier,

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.830
couldn't I have

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.050
negotiated with the Ministry of Justice?

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.310
Getting the proper documents
wouldn't have been difficult.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:27.200
Chief.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.590
It was my oversight.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.610
A perfect opportunity for redemption

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.440
has fallen into

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.440
the Secret Investigation Unit's hands
just like that.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.070
Huang Wuchang is connected to Yesha,

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.560
and he still has many secrets

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.270
that haven't been revealed.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:40.000
Chief.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:41.510
Could we request an audience
with His Majesty

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.590
to get him back from

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.750
the Secret Investigation Unit?

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.410
An audience with His Majesty?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.790
On what grounds?

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:48.480
Huang Wuchang

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.010
was captured
by our Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.200
But wasn't Yesha Xiao Beiming also from

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.830
our Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:55.480
Xiao...

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:02.720
Regardless of whether Xiao Beiming
is Yesha or not,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.240
as long as we can get Huang Wuchang,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.020
make him talk,

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.880
and solve the Yesha case,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.739
it would only benefit
our Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.280
Chief.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.159
The Yesha case

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.590
concerns the reputation of
our Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.880
Please don't hesitate anymore.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.190
I've confronted this man before.

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.280
He's completely insane,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.630
and interrogating him won't be easy.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.320
If he dies in the hands of
the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.630
we'll have no more leads
on the Yesha case.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.190
Uncle!

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.110
Why are you calling me uncle?

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.230
How many times have I told you

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.800
not to call me uncle here?

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.920
News just came

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:32.750
that the key criminal from Weizhou

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.110
was abducted

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.840
while being escorted back to the capital.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:48.280
You...

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.400
I'm incompetent

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.360
and failed to keep watch
over the key criminal.

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.110
His Majesty will summon us tomorrow.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.920
How should we explain this to him?

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.139
If His Majesty flies into a rage,

00:34:57.139 --> 00:34:59.000
I fear our deaths may soon follow!

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:00.310
It was my negligence.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.920
I'll take full responsibility.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.760
Now is not the time to be heroic.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.160
Come up with a solution
as soon as possible.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.290
[Sanli Teahouse]

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.740
Why have you come to see me?

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.400
Are you here to mock me

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.880
before I die,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.880
or did your conscience suddenly kick in

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.410
and you want to say goodbye?

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.000
Say goodbye?

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.480
Don't pretend that you don't know.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.320
My father and I

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.400
made a military pledge before His Majesty

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.920
to solve the Yesha case by the deadline.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.310
Now, the case remains unsolved,

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.000
and Huang Wuchang has been abducted.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.130
Tomorrow, His Majesty will summon us,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.490
which will likely be our death sentence.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.720
What exactly did you come to see me for?

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.320
There's only one way

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.680
to save you and your father.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.800
What's that?

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.860
Recapture Huang Wuchang.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:29.000
I can help you,

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.050
but you need to tell me

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.800
all the details about

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.070
Huang Wuchang's abduction.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.530
Otherwise, I can't help you
even if I want to.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.420
Even if I tell you

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.550
the inside story
of Huang Wuchang's abduction,

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.510
you won't be able

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.260
to catch him any time soon.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.510
So telling you makes no difference.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.540
That's not necessarily true.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.610
You know something, don't you?

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.360
For Huang Wuchang to be abducted

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.230
from under the tight security of
your Secret Investigation Unit,

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.760
while everyone from your unit

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.440
remained completely unharmed,

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:59.070
there's only one possibility:

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.030
poison was used.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.130
Someone did use poison.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.480
What else do you know?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.080
How was Huang Wuchang abducted?

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.070
I don't know the specifics,

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.550
but the people escorting Huang Wuchang

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:14.010
numbered at least a dozen,

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:15.710
all experts from
the Secret Investigation Unit,

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:17.440
with Zhuge Kongyun in command.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:18.200
How could that person abduct him

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.710
without harming a single person

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.070
under those circumstances?

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.000
Unless it was...

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.800
Old Bug.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.920
Xueman, but you need to

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.030
verify this information

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.150
with Zhuge Kongyun.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.880
But Old Bug has seen you before.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.280
If Zhuge Kongyun

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.630
learns this information

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:33.090
and finds him before we do,

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.010
your injuries will never heal,

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.880
and your whereabouts will be exposed.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.150
Our top priority now

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.630
is to find Huang Wuchang.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.190
Our strength alone isn't enough.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:44.120
We need
the Secret Investigation Unit's resources.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.230
Using Zhuge Kongyun's resources

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.710
to catch Old Bug,

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.630
while also trying to take Old Bug away

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.890
before he realizes it,

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.190
that's too risky.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.750
Given the situation,

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.290
we have no other choice.

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.230
That person actually managed

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.800
to silently poison

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.660
your Secret Investigation Unit.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:03.520
Whoever abducted him

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.190
must be a master of poison.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:06.360
I happen to know

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.420
someone like that,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.440
and he works for Yesha.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:12.880
Who is it?

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.360
Old Bug, from Poison Valley.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.320
Old Bug?

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:25.710
Someone released poisonous gas

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:27.110
into the air,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.670
and by the time I realized,

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:30.000
it was already too late.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.000
But how did Old Bug know?

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.590
The escort route was supposed to be
top secret.

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:43.390
That's right.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.000
I suspect there's

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.880
a spy within
the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.480
I'm investigating,

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.070
but right now,
I don't have the slightest clue.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.800
There must be a flaw somewhere.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.150
I'll keep investigating.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.980
Since I was able to

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:52.960
catch Huang Wuchang once,

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.110
I can certainly catch him a second time.

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.360
Waiter, bill please.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.990
Zhong Xueman!

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.470
What's wrong?

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:20.480
Beiming is gone.
