[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.970
[Episode 30]

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.430
How could my father have

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.070
the key to this secret chamber?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.789
Master was once

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.390
a member of the Canfeng Army.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.870
He must have had

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.400
some connection with Bei Hai

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.479
at Haiya back then.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.350
You just said

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.200
you figured out Bei Hai's identity.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.000
Who is he?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.950
I believe

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.110
he's my Junior Master Uncle.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.590
Isn't Old Bug

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.430
your only Master Uncle?

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:02.640
Junior Master Uncle

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.150
left Poison Valley long ago.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.560
I've never even met him.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.200
I only know from my master

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.400
that he had a junior

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.910
who was a prodigy.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.910
His talent for alchemy and poison-making

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.240
surpassed both Old Bug

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.910
and my master combined.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.310
He was the most

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.040
valued disciple in the valley.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.870
But then something happened

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.329
and he left Poison Valley.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.430
Are you saying

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.310
Bei Hai was poisoned
with the Separation Powder?

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.910
Yes.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.090
I've only heard that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.750
he traveled extensively

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.410
and once brought back a woman.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.060
He and that woman fell deeply in love.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.180
But unexpectedly,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.840
this woman turned out to be a spy

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.170
sent from another sect.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.120
Master.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.430
Lian has already

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.520
cut ties with them.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.030
I beg you, for my sake,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.740
please give us your blessing.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.670
[Panacea]

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.870
Junior Master Uncle
couldn't bring himself to harm her.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.590
In the end,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.240
the Valley Chief poisoned her himself.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.590
The poison used

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.650
was the Separation Powder.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.240
No one expected

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.630
that Junior Master Uncle's feelings

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.960
for that woman would be so deep.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.190
To save her,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.750
he knelt outside my master's door

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.240
for a day and a night.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.030
My master had read the Yin-Yang Book

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.520
and knew the antidote.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.800
But my master couldn't

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.280
disobey the Valley Chief's orders.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.150
In the end, Junior Master Uncle

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.840
actually tested the poison on himself,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.170
gambling with his life,

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.430
and successfully neutralized the poison.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.680
But after curing the poison,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.079
Junior Master Uncle took that woman

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.150
and fled from the valley,

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.880
disappearing without a trace.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.680
Testing poison on himself
and gambling with his life...

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.490
He had already made this decision

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.750
before he came.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.030
If he had failed,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.670
he might have died together

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.650
with that woman.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.079
Such confidence,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.840
such profound love!

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.079
The reason I suspect

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.560
this person is my junior master uncle

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.210
is because he's the only one who could

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.910
neutralize the Separation Powder.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.910
I can't think of anyone else

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.520
who could

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.870
use this poison to create such a puzzle.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.590
Bei Hai's underground chamber

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.590
was very likely prepared for

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.390
the disciples of Poison Valley.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.040
I can't make sense

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.640
of all these clues right now.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.450
Let's keep moving forward.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.270
Here's a torch.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.920
It works.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.390
Over here.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.800
Tong Shuang.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.800
Let's split up and search.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.510
Okay.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.510
Look here.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.120
A female corpse.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.040
A male corpse.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.880
They should be Bei Hai and his wife.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.310
Looks like they've been dead

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.510
for about 20 years.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.120
Lying here behind so many mechanisms,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.260
what secret were they hiding?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.730
There's a piece of cloth here.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.720
The 36th year of Ningtai.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.950
Come look at this.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.630
Let's go.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.190
The 36th year of Ningtai,

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.630
the Emperor was gravely ill.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.760
Turmoil spread throughout the court.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.950
The five border nations,
with their predatory ambitions,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.240
formed an alliance and attacked
without declaration of war.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.120
Border troops retreated,
civilians were displaced,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.520
predators ruled, and the nation crumbled.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.240
Just as the empire was about to collapse,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.650
a miraculous pill was discovered.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.820
[Swift Wind Pill]

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.320
The Swift Wind Pill.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.430
If this pill could be obtained,

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.760
it could turn the tides.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.630
However, no one anticipated

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.240
this would be
the beginning of a nightmare.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.630
You claim this pill can help

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.390
the Qi Kingdom turn the tides.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.560
Do you know that deceiving the Emperor

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.040
is punishable by death?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.120
This humble subject

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.630
would never dare deceive Your Majesty.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.159
Tell me,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.390
what exactly are
the miraculous effects of this pill?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.720
I shall boldly demonstrate it.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.120
Select a brave warrior
of the Qi Kingdom

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.430
and have him take this pill.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.890
Then Your Majesty
will witness its effects.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.870
Begin.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.840
Good.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:38.909
Excellent.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.120
I am fine.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.450
I never expected this medicine

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.750
could enable one man to fight ten.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.870
We'll definitely be able to
reclaim our lost territories.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.780
Heaven truly blesses the Qi Kingdom.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.260
My loyal minister,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.440
what is

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.910
this medicine called?

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.320
Swift Wind Pill.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.990
His Majesty believed

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.010
I was capable of saving the world.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.390
I spared no effort, working tirelessly

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.970
day and night to create it.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.630
It seems Bei Hai has recorded

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.840
everything that happened back then.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.550
This is what he went to such lengths

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.590
and created so many obstacles

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:33.950
to hide in this place.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.240
The situation was dire.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.760
I dared not be negligent.

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.080
The troops guarding Haiya

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.750
were called the Canfeng Army,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.510
commanded by Prince Wu Lie.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.480
They numbered one thousand strong.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.750
They took the pill before battle,

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.210
vowing to defeat the enemy

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.670
to protect our homeland.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.280
Then they secretly crossed the border,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.030
traveling day and night.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.840
[Canfeng Army]

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.510
Sandstorms raged without stop,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.600
so the allied forces' defenses were lax.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.690
We launched a surprise attack.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.200
Though we lost 800 men,

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.870
we killed the leaders

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.510
of all five enemy states.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.630
The imperial army
launched a counterattack.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:38.440
The civilians

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.870
welcomed us with food and drink.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.710
[Canfeng Army]

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:54.030
[Canfeng Army]

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.790
Just as the soldiers were about to rest,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.230
unexpected troubles arose again.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.480
After the Canfeng Army returned to Haiya,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.280
only 200 remained.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.450
But later,

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.360
someone suddenly went berserk

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.160
and attacked in all directions.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:34.080
So this is

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.850
the hidden history?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.540
Those three doors earlier

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.360
must have been designed

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.760
to protect this history.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.270
Sometimes lucid, sometimes deranged...

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.780
What's really going on?

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.970
I've never seen symptoms
like these before.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.510
Could it be because...

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.120
The number of casualties increased daily.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.000
Only then did I realize

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.440
that the Swift Wind Pill was the cause.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.580
I've roamed the martial world for decades,

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.210
priding myself on unmatched poison skills.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.360
But when the moment came,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.440
I realized the art of medicine

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.870
was as deep as the ocean.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.270
Thus, I exhausted all my knowledge

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.270
to search for an antidote.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.020
Little did I know
disaster was already upon us.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.120
He's finally come to his senses.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.680
Your diagnosis was correct.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.000
It was indeed the Swift Swift Wind Pill

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.510
that caused his symptoms.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.840
After taking the Swift Wind Pill,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.240
it causes rapid physical changes.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.230
I thought after stopping the medication,

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.290
one would recover.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.630
But the Swift Wind Pill's potency
runs deep,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.630
generating its own toxicity.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.600
Once discontinued,

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.200
the meridians cannot adapt.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.550
The stimulated internal energy

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.630
rampages chaotically
through the meridians.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.630
The toxins then surge into
the brain tissue,

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.270
causing hallucinations.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.720
While hallucinating,

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.000
they perceive everything around them

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.200
as threats

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.150
and attack without mercy.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.390
More and more people are affected.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.000
Many have been bitten by them.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.030
Did you follow

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:11.080
Master Bei Hai's instructions?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:11.670
Yes,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.270
they were lucid after taking it,

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.400
but after a few days,

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:15.790
they went mad again.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:18.530
So he wasn't cured.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.910
Instead, you gave him

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.770
even more Swift Swift Wind Pills.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.080
You must know that

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.790
if the toxin isn't neutralized,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.200
continuing to take the pills

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.720
may temporarily relieve symptoms,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.670
but it'll worsen the poisoning.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.240
Once the toxin penetrates the bones,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.600
the consequences will be devastating.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.630
I'm well aware of that,

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:36.910
which is why I must quickly find

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.910
an antidote.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240
Until then,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:41.720
we can only continue using
the Swift Wind Pills

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.360
to keep him temporarily lucid.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.240
It's our only option.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.240
What about

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:49.650
the other Canfeng Army soldiers?

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:50.750
What should we do?

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.910
The number of poisoned soldiers

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:53.840
is increasing.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And we're running out of pills.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.200
Has there been any response
from the capital?

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.240
My Lords,

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:05.390
the Haiya matter cannot be delayed.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.910
His Majesty is currently unwell.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.510
I'm afraid we must make a decision

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.000
on His Majesty's behalf.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.510
This is a serious matter.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.440
I'm just concerned that...

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.630
His Majesty has already issued the decree.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.240
The Crown Prince is too young.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.700
For urgent state affairs,

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.390
we may deliberate and decide.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.150
That may be so,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.080
but we should...

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.750
No need for further discussion.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:27.960
The situation is urgent.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.720
If we hesitate,

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.030
wouldn't we be failing
His Majesty's trust?

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.990
Indeed.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:37.550
Mr. Shen,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.390
if you have any good suggestions,
please speak freely.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:42.920
The four of us
will share the responsibility.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.390
Yes, indeed.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.960
The most urgent task now

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.880
is to contain this information

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.790
and absolutely prevent

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.720
news of the Canfeng Army's disease

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.750
from spreading beyond Haiya.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.120
Contain the information?

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.360
The situation has just stabilized

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.600
with complete victory at the border.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.670
There's growing public support.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:06.150
The matter of the Swift Wind Pill
is top secret.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.270
If the citizens of Qi Kingdom learn

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.840
that our heroic soldiers have

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.910
turned into mindless beasts overnight,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.070
it will certainly
cause panic among the people

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.870
and damage the imperial court's authority.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.230
There are rumors that

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.550
Bei Hai is already developing an antidote.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.670
What if

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.200
he can't develop an antidote in time?

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.540
By that time,

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.000
the Qi Kingdom will face

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.600
200 men who have lost their minds

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.390
and become incredibly violent monsters.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.360
They possess immense strength,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.620
kill without remorse,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.960
and fear no death.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.550
I'm afraid it will lead to

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.870
an unwithstandable catastrophe.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.480
Our current plan,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.600
besides containing information

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.630
and urging Bei Hai to develop an antidote,

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.790
must also include contingencies

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.240
if no antidote is found.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:55.790
My Lords,

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.150
His Majesty
just regained consciousness briefly.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:59.880
Does His Majesty have an order?

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.530
[Kill]

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.390
Strategist,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.870
is there truly no other way?

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.320
The imperial command cannot be defied.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.600
But they are all our brothers

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.120
who have fought alongside us
through thick and thin

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.850
and achieved such great merit
for the Qi Kingdom.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.630
How can we

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.290
bring ourselves to kill them?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:27.810
Strategist,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.030
could we send a message by carrier pigeon

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.890
and plead with His Majesty again?

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.720
General,

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:38.200
you understand His Majesty's mind best.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.320
Is this possible?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.390
Since the imperial decree has been issued,

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:43.630
there's no need to discuss this further.

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.560
Relay my orders.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.360
General,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.910
allow me to see Bei Hai

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.150
one last time.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.910
Bei Hai,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:58.490
how is the antidote coming along?

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.240
You created the pill,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.600
yet even you can't neutralize it?

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.390
The poison has already penetrated

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.790
into the bone marrow of these 200 men.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:06.190
There's nothing I can do.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.400
How many Swift Wind Pills are left?

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.210
Only enough for them
to take one last dose.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.750
But even if they take more
Swift Wind Pills,

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.790
they can now barely maintain clarity

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.109
for half a day.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:19.880
After half a day,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.760
they will completely transform

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.349
into beasts.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.140
Any news from the capital?

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.160
Report!

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.830
General, the city is surrounded.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.960
Go ahead.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.680
Attack!

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.690
Kill them quickly!

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:31.640
General,

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.440
we've lost contact with
the two additional teams

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.040
we just sent in.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.710
General, should I

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.400
lead another team inside?

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.960
How many men do we have left?

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.070
Only two battalions left.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.780
They've completely lost their minds

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.200
and are now scattered throughout the city.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.640
Once the fighting gets to the alleys,

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.070
sending more men in

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.610
would just be sending them
to their deaths.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.400
Canfeng Army, attention!

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.350
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.200
Withdraw all forces outside the city,

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.160
lock the gates,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.850
and allow no one to leave.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:10.720
General,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.510
there are still innocent civilians inside,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.680
thousands of elderly, children, and women

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.680
who have no way to defend themselves

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.110
against those savage beasts.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.680
They're facing certain death.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.830
I request permission
to lead troops back in.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:21.110
Even if we die fighting,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.350
we must rescue

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.770
these civilians first!

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.240
General!

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:28.710
-General!
-General!

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.680
Wu Lie's order

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.030
caused the people of Haiya

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.030
to be like fish awaiting slaughter,

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.590
while the men who've gone mad

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.160
massacred all
until nothing was left to be killed.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.890
Then they turned on each other,

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:43.400
turning Haiya into hell on earth.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.510
Turned into hell...

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.120
There should still be

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.110
survivors who escaped this catastrophe.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.750
General,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.680
there's still time to save them.

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.480
Go find

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.030
all those civilians.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.070
Yes.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:48.610
Kill without mercy,

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.400
General!

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.240
Execute the military order.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.960
General,

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.000
Haiya's chaos has been quelled.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.240
Why must we slaughter the innocent?

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.000
Because they

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.960
must die.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.610
His Majesty is gravely ill
with little time left.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.200
The Crown Prince is young
with no power base.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.880
Internally, the nobles are restless,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.920
and externally, our enemies
are watching like tigers.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.680
If what happened in Haiya leaked out,

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.510
it would certainly be exploited
by those with ulterior motives.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.110
The country would be thrown into chaos,

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.920
the entire nation in turmoil.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.320
Who would bear the crime?

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.350
But these people of Haiya

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.200
are also citizens of the Qi Kingdom.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.030
I know.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.070
Of course I know.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.890
They are citizens of the Qi Kingdom

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.030
and all are innocent people.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.680
I know that once this order is given,

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.320
there's no turning back.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.480
But for the sake of the entire Qi Kingdom,

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.110
for the sake of even more innocent lives,

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.550
I...

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.750
I have no choice.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:57.960
After this is done,

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.440
I will personally ask His Majesty
for punishment.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.680
I will bear

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.280
all responsibility alone.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.300
Execute the order.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.480
General!

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.400
Those who disobey...

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440
Will be executed!

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.160
Put that baby down.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.720
-General said we can’t keep any of them.
-He’s just a baby.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.750
I said put him down!

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.640
Yunchi,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:03.350
put the baby down!

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.310
Yunchi,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.510
I know you're upset,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.280
but what the General said

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:17.790
isn't wrong.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.070
But we are human beings!

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.110
We're not animals.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.110
Yunchi, give me the baby!

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.030
[Tong Xin]

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:25.790
No!

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:27.110
What for?

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.610
For you to kill him?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.720
Can an infant reveal secrets,

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.250
or threaten the Qi Kingdom?

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.640
We're committing such terrible sins.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.550
Heaven will surely punish us.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:43.000
Zongyao,

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.180
your family is waiting for you to return.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.720
Tong,

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.160
isn't your wife

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.160
newly with child?

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.030
Let us

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.590
spare some lives in Haiya.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.240
Just treat it as...

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.100
As building some good karma
for our families, okay?

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.030
If the General truly blames someone,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.450
I'll take all responsibility.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.480
I won't implicate any of you.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.400
I knew it had to be you.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.200
Looking back now,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.830
those years I roamed

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.770
the martial world with you,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:05.270
cracking criminal cases,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.130
were the happiest days of my life.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.440
It's just a pity

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:12.200
that I don't have time

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.150
to share one last drink with you.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.310
Can we go somewhere else?

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.640
I don't want them

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.240
to see me in my final moments.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.550
I discovered this underground cave

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:40.160
by accident.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.550
I spent several years

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.850
setting up mechanisms

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.960
to turn it into a secret chamber.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.790
You've already seen

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:48.720
the way

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.920
to solve these mechanisms just now.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.030
Why did you bring me here?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.750
I caused the Haiya disaster.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.680
Even if I die a thousand times,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.590
it won't atone for my sin.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.400
But before I die,

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.170
there are some things I must do.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.510
And only you

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.000
can help me.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.200
What can I do for you?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.880
Three things.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.640
First,

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.000
I want you to take
this Swift Wind Pill

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.070
to Poison Valley

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.340
and give it to my senior Wu Shuang.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.680
The Poison Valley Chief?

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.350
Even if those

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.550
soldiers poisoned by the pill are dead,

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.830
I cannot guarantee

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.030
that the Swift Wind Pill
hasn't spread elsewhere.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.890
If someone exploits this poison,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.020
it can throw the world into chaos.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.350
In the arts of medicine and poison,

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.810
the only one superior to me

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.270
is my senior.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.440
Years ago, due to some past matters,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.680
we became enemies.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.200
But I know he is righteous.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.920
He will certainly find a way

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.250
to develop an antidote.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.460
Once there's an antidote,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.010
the source of all calamity
will be cut off.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.640
What's the second thing?

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.000
[Swift Wind Pill]

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.400
What is this?

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.590
These are

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.510
the things

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.370
that happened in Haiya recently.

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.480
Why did you

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.270
carve all this here?

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:37.270
If I'm not mistaken,

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:38.240
I fear Wu Lie

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.680
followed His Majesty's orders

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.140
to burn Haiya to the ground

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.790
and destroy

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.550
the mountain path leading there,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.590
making Haiya

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.070
vanish from this world completely.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.310
Aren't you worried

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.880
that I might destroy it?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.790
You won't.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:55.480
Why not?

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.350
Because you understand better than I do

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.030
that the poison in people's hearts

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.890
is worse than any poisonous pill.

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.960
Of all the people I know,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.380
you're the worthiest
of being called a hero.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.240
You know that even if

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.960
slaughter can temporarily stabilize
the situation,

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.880
covering up

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.110
has never been

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:21.480
a way to solve evil.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.400
It only allows hatred to take root,

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.270
letting this blood feud

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.070
continue for generations,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.510
until one day,

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.030
it creates an even greater disaster.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.690
By then, even with an antidote,

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.400
the poison of hatred won't be cured.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:43.240
Because the most poisonous thing
is the human heart.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.440
Is this

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.270
the key to this secret chamber?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.720
If my senior

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.590
spends his whole life and is still

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.550
unable to develop an antidote like me,

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:04.680
then this thumb ring

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.550
will be the hope I leave for Haiya

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.310
and the Qi Kingdom.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.040
If disaster strikes again,

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.200
I hope you

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.750
can choose someone like yourself,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.200
someone with a righteous heart,

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.130
and bring to this underground tomb

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.240
to open the secret chamber

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.440
and reveal the truth.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.960
I've left the formula for
the Swift Wind Pill

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.960
here as well.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.960
If they can't solve it either,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.260
let them pass it on to future generations

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.670
until someone solves it.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.240
When that time comes, I hope all the truth

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.550
will be revealed to the world.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.410
This way, whether it's disasters

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.040
caused by the pill's poison
or by human hearts,

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.070
they might truly come to an end.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.330
What's the third thing?

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:07.480
The third thing...

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.530
I beg you to protect my wife and children.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.580
I deserve punishment.
My death matters little.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.920
But they should live.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:19.230
You must promise me this.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.680
Darling.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.350
You...

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.030
If I survive,

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.520
I'll only burden the children.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.310
General.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:19.310
The children...

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.070
I'll entrust them to you.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.480
In my life, I've failed four people.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.160
The first is my senior brother Wu Shuang,

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.240
to whom I owe everything.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.040
His kindness is unforgettable,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.000
but I was stubborn and arrogant,

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.570
and broke ties with him.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.790
Second, my beloved wife Xiao,

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:40.510
deeply loving and loyal,

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.590
yet I must leave her behind.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.350
And my sons Bei Kun and Bei Ming,

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.480
for having failed my duty as their father.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.680
I scarred their shoulders with incense

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.350
to pray for their safety.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.110
Beiming.

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.790
Bei Hai's child Bei Ming...

00:33:57.270 --> 00:33:58.310
Could it be...

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.190
The King Zhong of Constables

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.030
didn't give you his surname Zhong

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.280
because your mother's surname was Xiao.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.590
Mrs. Xiao's remains

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.150
are in this secret chamber.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.190
This proves

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.420
she didn't choose to leave back then.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.159
Instead, she stayed here

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:35.070
with Bei Hai.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.540
If that's the case,

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.360
Beiming, you have

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.690
a brother named Bei Kun.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.230
But my father only took you away

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.280
at that time.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.080
We don't know where he went.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.400
Only Wu Lie knows.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:02.960
In any case,

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.030
he must also

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.190
be on that list.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.510
It's just that

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:08.270
we don't know who adopted him

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.720
or what name he was given.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.360
He is your only family.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.310
We will definitely find him.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.520
There's another stone wall over there.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.880
So this is

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.880
the formula for the Swift Wind Pill.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.360
Old Bug really was something.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.360
He almost perfectly

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.000
replicated the Swift Wind Pill.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.840
Bei Hai once had King Zhong of Constables

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.900
give the Swift Wind Pill to my master.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.920
But Old Bug

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.400
killed my master before he could

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.800
create the antidote.

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:48.590
If he were still alive,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.110
he would certainly have figured it out.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.000
Don't be sad.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:54.800
You were your master's

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.060
most prized disciple.

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.320
Our arrival here today

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.000
must be fate.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.030
This is the important task

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.400
your master left for you,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.510
and his dying wish.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.230
But this formula is extremely important.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:09.230
It must not fall into Yesha's hands.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.280
You must commit it firmly to memory.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.230
I also believe

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:13.670
that someday, you will definitely

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.930
develop the antidote.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.110
It seems Bei Hai

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.480
left us a way back.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:13.360
Beiming.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.920
Take them with.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:15.960
When you get back,

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.420
give them a proper burial.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.000
They erected a blank tombstone
in the courtyard,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.400
They probably wanted to rest here forever.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.230
Let's go.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.570
Look out!

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:05.040
Earthquake!
