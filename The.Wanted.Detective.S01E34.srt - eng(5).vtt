[Gongzheng Gate]

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.190
You finally came.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900
It really is you.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.800
Why?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.680
Why?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.120
Why?

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.470
Why?

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.240
Why?

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.750
Well done.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.840
I owed you that.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.430
What exactly do you want?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.630
What do I want?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.030
Now the whole world knows

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.120
that I am Yesha.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.320
I have nowhere to run.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.240
I'm here to turn myself in.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.430
You really think we would believe

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.030
your nonsense?

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.680
Believe it or not.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.960
Could this country

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.120
ask for a better situation

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.560
than having me here,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.079
completely at your mercy?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.150
He is Bei Kun,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.080
Bei Hai's son.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.090
And he is also Beiming's...

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.480
Now tell me,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.600
should I be calling you "big brother,"

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.400
or should you be calling me that?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.750
All of you, get out.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.800
I need to speak with him alone.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.800
Alright.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.270
We'll wait outside.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.240
That's not safe.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.970
Don't worry.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.750
He's had plenty of chances

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.950
to kill me over the years if he wanted to.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.440
He wouldn't have come all this way

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.370
just to do it now.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.390
Leave them alone.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.050
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.430
Why did you do this?

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.920
"Why?"

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.350
Isn't everything

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.159
written clearly enough
on the wanted poster?

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.000
Haven't you, Xiao Beiming,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.260
already figured everything out

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.610
clearly?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.240
I want to hear you say it yourself—

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.610
they were all killed

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.950
by you.

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.720
Fine.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.750
I'll repeat that for you.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:56.390
Shen Bi,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.040
Lu Wenzhong,

Fan Jingzhi,

Tong Xin,

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.720
Wu Zhui,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.070
and your master,

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.560
Zhong Yunchi—

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.390
all those who committed atrocities

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.480
in Haiya

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.560
were killed by me.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.480
You stayed by my side

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.750
just to get that key?

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.870
That's right,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.720
but that's only part of it.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.360
The real reason is

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.270
that I wanted you to see

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.920
the truth about Haiya.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.950
I've always believed

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.720
that if there were problems

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.270
even I couldn't solve,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.750
only you,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.600
Xiao Beiming, could solve them.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.520
I wanted to see what choice you'd make.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.630
However,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.130
your choice has disappointed me greatly.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.240
I've already discussed Haiya

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.870
in depth with His Majesty,

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.510
and he has agreed to

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.630
lift the blockade on Haiya,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.159
rescue the remaining people,

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.390
and issue an imperial edict of self-reproach

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.480
to give the world an explanation.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.800
The moment you were reinstated
to your position,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.830
I guessed as much.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.830
Then why did you still

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.030
kill Wu Zhui in front of everyone today?

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.760
Losing your temper?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.190
To me,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.000
those so-called compensations

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.120
or apologies

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.560
are nothing but ridiculous attempts

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.720
to ease your own conscience.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.720
They can't change anything,

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.210
especially what has already happened.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.370
Then why did you turn yourself in?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.570
Even though I'm Yesha,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.830
I've also endured hardships,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.630
working in the Elite Constabulary Unit
for so long with you.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.830
I can't say that I feel nothing.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.750
Besides,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.920
watching you all

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.800
chase your tails at my whim

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.600
made me feel somewhat guilty.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.360
Go ahead. Do it.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.270
Well, well.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.160
The ever-calm you

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.510
can actually lose control.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.210
After all these years,

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.750
this is the first time
I've seen you lose control.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.350
What exactly happened to you

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.360
to turn you into what you are today?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.260
"What happened to me?"

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.110
I figured

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.480
you'd ask me that.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.789
After all, you always think

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.850
you've suffered unbearably in life.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.480
You watched your parents

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.440
die before your eyes

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.000
but couldn't do anything about it.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.200
You watched your former lover

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.270
regard you as a mortal enemy

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.270
and draw her sword against you.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.360
Your martial arts skills are
completely gone,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.440
you're poisoned,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.870
and you don't have much time left to live.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.440
And now you realize

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.170
that despite all your efforts,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.360
you've been nothing more than a pawn

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.720
in my hands.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.440
You're the greatest constable
in the country,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.750
yet you've been framed, used, and deceived

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.750
by those closest to you.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.170
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.720
It's because you always think

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.000
you are the most wronged

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and suffering person in this world.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.240
So you always have to ask others

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.000
what they've been through

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.960
just so you can

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.960
look down from on high and say,

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.960
"Look,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.630
I, Xiao Beiming, have suffered so much,

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.870
yet I never strayed from the right path.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.550
You've ended up like this

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.200
all because of your own fault, right?"

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.320
Fine.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.720
Let me tell you,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.390
your so-called suffering is nothing

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.360
compared to what I've endured.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.440
Who let you in here?

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.750
Get out!

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.600
Did you sneak in to steal something?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.840
Madam, please don't be upset.
Please don't be upset.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.510
The Second Young Master is just a kid.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.960
He doesn't know any better.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.550
What "second young master"?

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.670
He's just some bastard

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.480
who popped up

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
from who-knows-where.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.910
He's dirtied the floor
of my East Courtyard.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:13.750
Mr. Hai,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.600
don't give him any food today,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.670
so this bastard

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.150
learns to know his place.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.600
Regardless, he's still
our Second Young Master.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.330
How did he end up in such a state?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.390
He was brought back

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.440
by Master Tong when Master Tong returned home

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.260

Back then, Madam

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.270
was absolutely furious.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.910
That's right.

One more thing.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.920
The real reason I turned myself in

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.250
was to tell you all this:

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.270
no matter where I am,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.030

Everything you've done

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.310

what he meant

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.030

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.240

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.790
show no remorse whatsoever.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.390
So why did he turn himself in?

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.310
Could he have some other scheme?

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.680
If that's the case,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.880
since he'll be executed tomorrow,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.810
he only has tonight to carry it out.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:49.960
That's impossible.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.440
The Heavenly Prison is heavily guarded.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.510
Even with all his skills,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.070
he couldn't pull anything off there.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.510
Could it be

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.370
that he's trained another Yesha?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.110
Perhaps he wants to be like Miao Jie—

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.110
using his own death

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:01.640

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.520
There's no point in him doing that.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.480
Since we can't figure it out,

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.720
I'll go to the Heavenly Prison tonight

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.850
to watch him myself.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.790
I won't let him out of my sight

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.280

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.640

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.750

and the Heavenly Prison constables,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.480

-Greetings, Constable Zhong.
-Greetings, Constable Zhong.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.440
By His Majesty's order,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.920
we're guarding the prisoner tonight.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.250
I'd like to check on him.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.400
It seems you're all

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.310
still worried about what I might do.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.550
Even though I'm locked up
in a place like this,

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.830
you still have to come
and watch me personally, sister-in-law.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.460
No, wait,

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.380
I should call you
my younger sister-in-law now.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.480
After all, we've known each other
for a long time

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.240
and been through life and death together.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.590
Now that I've fallen to this state,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.640
don't you have anything

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.730
to say to me?

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.240
Don't you think I'm pitiful?

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.000
The Tong Shuang who once

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.590
fought alongside us—

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.750
I consider him

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.340
already dead in Haiya.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.510
What stands before me now

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.070
is nothing but

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.920
a murderous monster that happens

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.160
to look like him.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:35.440
I don't care

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.680
what schemes you have.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.440
You won't escape the blade

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.120
coming for your head.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.270
That's fair.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.270
You should indeed hate me

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.440
more than anyone.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.590
After all, Zhong Yunchi's death

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.880
was my doing.

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.440
I am the one

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.100
who truly killed your father.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.830
Listen to me,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.850
if it weren't for the fact

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.050
that I'm a constable,

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.950
and if it weren't for the law,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.070
you would've already died

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.830
back at the Elite Constabulary Unit.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.590
Tomorrow,

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.160
I will witness with my own eyes

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.640
as your head falls.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.520
I'm also looking forward to seeing

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.370
the expressions on your faces tomorrow.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.000
Are you still thinking about

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.600
the Demonized Four Symbols?

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.790
Everything is settled now.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.830
No need to worry anymore.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.270
I hope so.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.310
It's just that I feel a little uneasy.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.750
There's nothing to feel uneasy about.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.270
He's currently imprisoned

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.030
on the 17th floor of the Heavenly Prison.

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.200
Besides Zhong Xueman,

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.510
two top imperial guards

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.770
are also watching him.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.000
Even if he had
unparalleled martial arts skills,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.130
he would find it impossible to escape.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.080
Yesha never underestimates anything.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.030
But now

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.960
only a few hours remain until dawn.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.480
I really can't think of anything

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.680
he could possibly do now.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.750
No matter where I am,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.330
what is meant to happen will still happen.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.590
On which floor did you just say

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.110
Yesha was imprisoned?

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.350
The 17th floor.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.100
I should have realized it sooner.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.330
What's that smell?

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.100
Seems like something's burning.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.720
It's coming from below,

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.590
from the 18th floor.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.190
Check on the prisoner first.

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.240
Has something happened?

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.370
Why does it feel

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:28.030
so hot in here?

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.440
Is that...

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.610
a bird calling?

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.730
How could there be birds
in the Heavenly Prison?

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.880
You keep guard here.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.110
I'll go downstairs and check.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.400
Well...

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.640
The prisoner on the floor below
is of great importance.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.440
I'll report to His Majesty later.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.440
If anything happens,
I'll take full responsibility.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.880
Xueman.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.720
Xueman.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.790
Xueman.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:53.960
Xueman!

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.360
She's just unconscious.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.500
Go check there.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.790
Wake up!

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.920
Wu Lie is dead!

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.830
Xueman.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.960
Xueman. Xueman.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.310
What happened?

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.980
The Vermilion Bird...

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.070
I saw the Vermilion Bird.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.270
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.920
Xueman,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.070
stop dwelling on what happened just now.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.350
Didn't you say yourself

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.150
that those were just illusions?

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.880
This time is different.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.480
When the White Tiger attacked,
I was at the scene,

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.270
but Beiming and I were

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.640
only watching from a distance
outside the crowd.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.550
This time was different.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.680
I saw the Vermilion Bird with my own eyes

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.480
as it flew straight toward me.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.590
I truly felt

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.400
its attack.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.720
The sensation was real.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.650
An illusion couldn't create that.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.510
Bird talon marks.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:39.320
Look at this.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.810
I found it on the ground.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.830
Judging by the feather's length

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:45.830
and the depth of the talon marks,

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.790
that bird is likely

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.030
larger than any bird

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.030
we've ever known.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.880
It seems

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.240
that, just as Zhong Xueman said,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.040
a giant red bird did appear here.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.600
I've examined the body.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.400
The cause of death is
similar to Wu Zhui's.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.070
The deceased suffered

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.350
multiple external wounds and burns.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.270
The fatal wound

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.830
was a penetrating injury to the neck

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.350
that caused death by blood loss.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.110
But what injured him
wasn't an ordinary weapon—

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.640
it was more like a bird's beak or talons.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.480
Wu Lie was a peerless master.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.810
No ordinary person could have harmed him.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920
Could it really be

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.790
the Vermilion Bird?

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.110
If it really wasn't an illusion,

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.510
then does that mean

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.070
he can actually summon

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.330
a divine beast in his cell to kill
for him?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.840
But how is that possible?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.830
Why are you collecting these insects?

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.270
There were insects like these at the scene

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.000
where Mr. Wu Zhui was murdered.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.790
If ants that died in the same manner

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.400
appear at two crime scenes,

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.710
it can't be a coincidence

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.030
but rather the key to solving the cases.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.510
Let's go.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.920
Was it you?

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.160
That's right.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.410
I summoned the Vermilion Bird.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.920
I told you—

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.550
no matter where I am,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:32.720
what's meant to happen will happen.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.290
When the Four Symbols become demons,
Qi's fall is inevitable.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.400
Even if

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.920
my head rolls tomorrow,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.070
you still can't stop any of it.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:43.810
You turned yourself in

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.200
just to kill Wu Lie?

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.000
Not just that.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.400
The day is about to break,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.200
and my time is almost here!

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:56.350
And you

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:58.510
are the perfect audience.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.160
Make sure to watch carefully tomorrow.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.950
[Peace]

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.920
Everything is ready?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.200
It's time!

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.720
Bring in the accused, Yesha!

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.310
[Tranquility]

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.350
So, he is Yesha!

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:37.480
He looks so young.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.960
Isn't he that constable

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.050
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:41.020
Indeed, he is.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.440
That's him!

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.350
He's Yesha?

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.750
By the mandate of heaven,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.400
the Emperor decrees:

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:14.970
the vile criminal Bei Kun,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.640
known as "Yesha,"

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.000
has repeatedly broken the law,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.510
murdered innocent civilians,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.030
slaughtered loyal officials,

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.680
and plotted to overthrow the throne.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.270
His crimes are heinous

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.000
and beyond pardon!

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.160
By His Majesty's decree,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.960
he is sentenced to death by beheading

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.160
to uphold the law of the land

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.720
and serve as a warning to all.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.960
Today's execution

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.510
demonstrates the criminal's evil nature,

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:38.030
the clarity of heavenly justice,

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.240
the severity of the law,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.370
and His Majesty's benevolence.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.510
[Peace]

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:43.030
You should all take Bei Kun as a warning.

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.070
Do not follow his example,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.880
or you will face heaven's wrath

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.550
and meet a terrible fate!

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.790
Why are you laughing?

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.680
"Do not follow his example,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.030
or you will face heaven's wrath."
Such fine words.

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:00.310
This country's fortune has long been
exhausted.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.550
You dare to blaspheme the divine

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.880
and disregard Heaven's will.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.210
You'll surely bring down Heaven's wrath.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.440
When that time comes,
all living beings will suffer

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.800
and the world will grieve—

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.000
it will all be your fault,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.030
and even dying countless times
couldn't atone for it.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.320
We cannot let him off easily.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.780
Even as death approaches,

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.690
you still spread vicious lies!

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.760
If you don't believe me,

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.320
just wait and see.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.110
I'll see for myself

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.510
what divine retribution awaits

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.460
after we execute a villain like you,

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.460
full of arrogance and evil.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.110
The time has come.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.440
Execute him!

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.800
[Behead]

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.000
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.360
Kill him!

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.440
Kill him!

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.800
Watch closely.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:35.110
Look! There are colorful clouds
in the sky!

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280
Colorful clouds?

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.610
-Over there!
-Over there!

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.230
This is a bad omen.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.760
He's gone.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.440
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.300
Where did he go?

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.730
The Qi Kingdom will fall,

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.270
as Heaven has decreed!

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.190
Revere Heaven's will

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.040
to receive its protection!

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.470
The Qi Kingdom will fall,
as Heaven has decreed...

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.000
What on earth is happening?

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.880
Is His Majesty enraged?

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.590
How could he not be?

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.440
He almost had

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.840
both our heads cut off!

00:36:58.110 --> 00:36:59.480
What's happened over the past few days

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.920
is truly unprecedented.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.280
Now, throughout the entire capital,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.070
every street and alley is buzzing
with talk.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.470
They're talking about what Tong Shuang...

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.110
Yesha said at the execution site,

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.110
as well as the proclamations from the sky.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.170
They've already spread everywhere.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.280
Not only that,

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.590
but many commoners have secretly started

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.480
worshipping Yesha

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.680
with spirit tablets,

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.190
hoping to receive protection

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:21.650
and avoid the so-called divine punishment.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.640
So this was his real purpose
in surrendering.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:29.360
All this time, we've been focusing on

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.960
Haiya and the Swift Wind Pill.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.490
Now, I finally understand.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:34.230
What he wants

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.890
goes far beyond mere revenge.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.690
He wants to destroy
the very soul of our country.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.080
Destroy the soul of our country?

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.400
Someone with divine powers,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.920
impervious to all weapons,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.860
who can command divine beasts,
awaken deities,

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.400
and control the life and death

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:49.190
of any mortal

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:50.360
anywhere in the world at will—

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.440
what kind of being is that?

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.360
It's a god.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.630
He used us

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.110
to transform himself into a god,

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.670
step by step, before the eyes of all.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.710
After today,

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.280
aside from us,

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:02.920
no one will care whether Yesha is

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.150
a murderous demon

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:05.320
or what crimes he's committed.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.580
They will only believe

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.440
that everything he did before was

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:09.150
Heaven's will,

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:10.320
and everything he says and does hereafter

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.880
will be regarded as divine oracles.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.680
Rumors will continue to spread.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.670
His followers will grow in number.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.320
When that happens,

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.710
he'll be able to

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.630
manipulate people's minds effortlessly.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.830
And on top of all that,

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.920
he has the Swift Wind Pill.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.440
If he really uses it...

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.920
That would truly be Heaven's punishment.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:29.880
We must stop him,

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:32.150
or the world will plunge into chaos.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.800
But everyone saw those divine beasts

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:35.360
with their own eyes.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.480
If we can't find the key to this mystery,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.110
how can we strip away

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:39.630
his divine facade?

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.030
What's worse,

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.710
the Vermilion Bird, the White Tiger,

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.170
and today's Azure Dragon—

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.670
three of the Four Symbols—
have already appeared,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.840
with only the Black Tortoise left.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840
We don't even know

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.280
what he'll do with the Black Tortoise

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.410
when the time comes.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.550
I found these at the execution site.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.960
Those ants again.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:57.160
Time is running out.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.360
To crack the mystery of the Four Symbols,

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.220
we can only start with these ants.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.510
I know someone

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.320
who might be able to help.
