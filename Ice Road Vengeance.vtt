02:42.123 --> 02:43.360
Correct. Yeah.

02:47.927 --> 02:49.861
[Psychiatrist] Do
you know much about this, Mike?

02:51.835 --> 02:55.471
-I've... I've heard of it.
-It's pretty self
-explanatory.

02:57.139 --> 02:58.205
Your brother died.

02:59.274 --> 03:03.041
Deep down in a place you can't
talk about, you wish it had been
you, and not him.

03:03.343 --> 03:04.810
And this causes...

03:05.685 --> 03:06.651
behaviour.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.852
Like climbing
The Needles with no rope.

03:10.154 --> 03:12.356
That would be an example, yeah.

03:13.157 --> 03:14.985
You need to get closure on this.

03:15.854 --> 03:17.692
I'm gonna write
you two prescriptions,

03:17.794 --> 03:21.065
one for anxiety and something to
help you sleep if you need it.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.797
Yes to the literature,
no to the drugs.

05:57.684 --> 05:59.853
It is the way of the future.

06:00.488 --> 06:01.952
And with your approval...

06:02.621 --> 06:08.664
this dam will generate 4,000
megawatts of hydroelectricity
for industry.

06:09.331 --> 06:10.897
And with industry...

06:11.431 --> 06:12.734
comes jobs.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.367
And then all will be resettled.

Oh, right you are,
sir! Into slums!

the Life Estates that were...

granted to my family
by the Land Act in 1994.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.861
And that includes my
son who, is also late.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.362

late for his own funeral.

08:24.267 --> 08:25.269

no?

who want the dam. Yes.

But we...

08:35.476 --> 08:36.471
all of us.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.182
We need our river, no.

08:39.585 --> 08:43.049
To... to make tea
and to... to bathe...

08:43.585 --> 08:45.382
and to water our crops.

08:45.918 --> 08:47.724
If we give up on this now...

08:48.658 --> 08:51.453
we will lose
more than our river.

08:52.632 --> 08:56.000
We will sever
our links with our ancestors.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.865
We will cease to
be one with this land,

Well, she ain't
making it up to Everest.

34:36.037 --> 34:37.740
Not today at least. But...

34:38.409 --> 34:42.909
I reckon a spot weld might get
her down to the Araniko Highway.

34:43.579 --> 34:47.009
I'm a fair hand with a welding
torch, if you've got one.

34:47.145 --> 34:48.485

you know about Buddhists.

What kind of trouble?

37:05.182 --> 37:06.322
Dad?

37:07.055 --> 37:08.221
It's a land dispute.

it was unbelievable.

my country for your ordeal.

39:12.478 --> 39:13.846

in your care, Vijay Rai.

What about him?

39:19.420 --> 39:21.281
-This way.
-May I see him?

You'll miss your bus.

I can arrange a car service.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.355
And the reason, if I may ask.

39:28.091 --> 39:30.163
We all went through
an ordeal this morning.

39:30.265 --> 39:31.467
I'd like to know for whom.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.367
Hmm, I understand.

39:34.669 --> 39:37.373
Unfortunately,
Mr Rai is still unconscious.

39:37.675 --> 39:40.843

-My lieutenant was mistaken.

He won't sell to you.

41:19.438 --> 41:20.477
Then you will.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.875
Never.

will when you're all dead.

which I say, bullshit.

Well, there's never been one bus
go off the East Traverse in
the dry season.

42:51.367 --> 42:52.569
-Not a one.
-Right.

42:53.037 --> 42:54.294
Now get this.

43:06.814 --> 43:08.678
Tell them to go
ahead, Dhani. Please.

43:09.148 --> 43:11.453
Keep talking, Professor.
You've got my attention.

Bugger, me.

43:26.666 --> 43:28.465
Dhani, you catching this?

43:28.567 --> 43:29.597
It is possible.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.498
Rudra Yash is Kathmandu Mafia.

43:32.600 --> 43:36.111
Thugs and parasites.
They buy judges and police.

43:36.580 --> 43:38.439
What do you suggest
we do, Professor?

43:39.448 --> 43:40.480
Demand to see Vijay Rai.

43:40.582 --> 43:42.913
[foreboding music continues]

43:43.015 --> 43:45.150
-You are poking a dragon.
-[chuckles]

43:45.252 --> 43:48.485
-I've poked one or two before,
trust me.
-I want answers.

43:49.121 --> 43:52.090
You may need
a translator. Dhani, can you?

43:54.591 --> 43:55.591
Yes.

43:55.693 --> 43:56.825
Stay here, okay?

43:57.194 --> 43:58.666

I want you to skim

We're gonna need some

I'm an atheist.

It's easy to live as an atheist.

Not so easy to die as one.

01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:30.405
-There's no time.
-[Dhani] Quiet.

01:13:32.801 --> 01:13:40.173
[foreboding music continues]

01:13:43.178 --> 01:13:46.284
There is a first aid
kit under the driver's seat.

01:13:46.387 --> 01:13:47.282
-[Vijay] Driver's seat.
-Yeah.

01:13:47.384 --> 01:13:48.885
Vijay, go. Go.

01:13:51.391 --> 01:13:53.926
Um, I... I have a surgical kit.

01:13:54.228 --> 01:13:55.260
-Get it.
-[Ganesh] Yes.

01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:00.259
Here.

01:14:01.401 --> 01:14:03.300

[Rudra] No sleep tonight.

01:14:23.453 --> 01:14:27.253
We're going to search every inch
of the Highlands until
we find them.

01:14:29.597 --> 01:14:31.723
Everything that's
unnecessary, it goes.

01:14:32.359 --> 01:14:35.162
We will make this bus
as light as we can, okay?

01:14:36.367 --> 01:14:37.335
Why, Baba?

01:14:37.971 --> 01:14:40.040
Well, it makes it easier for
the crane, you know, because...

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:41.239
Oh, I hadn't told you.

01:14:41.441 --> 01:14:42.972
The bridge isn't built yet.

01:14:44.107 --> 01:14:46.437
[Vijay] Wait. Are we going
to crane over the gorge?

01:14:46.539 --> 01:14:49.484
Like we did in the old
days. In a much older crane.

01:14:50.615 --> 01:14:52.410
I wish I'd seen the old days.

01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:56.348
What? You will see the new days.

01:14:56.958 --> 01:14:58.024
See...

01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.488
I am old. [chuckles]

01:14:59.823 --> 01:15:02.288
-I am ready to go.
-Don't say that.

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:03.830
Baba.

01:15:04.332 --> 01:15:05.865
Grandpa lived almost a century.

01:15:06.334 --> 01:15:08.096
But our grandfather is tough.

01:15:08.797 --> 01:15:11.297
Me? Nah. Not so much.

01:15:12.504 --> 01:15:13.403

01:15:16.474 --> 01:15:17.941
I am no such thing.

You know...

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:23.782
I haven't done one
heroic thing in my life.

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:27.852
You're a hero to me, Papa.

01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:32.322
[chuckles]

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:34.391

01:16:43.364 --> 01:16:44.522
Yeah tell me what to do.

01:16:48.568 --> 01:16:50.598
Go to the lake and refill this.

You were a fool to not tell me.

01:21:09.697 --> 01:21:11.391
You could have gotten us killed.

[Vijay] With this new dam...

smaller yet
sufficient to meet our needs...

01:40:40.992 --> 01:40:44.329

our river and electricity.

We talked about the summit, bro.

01:42:03.684 --> 01:42:05.041
But given my age...

01:42:05.885 --> 01:42:07.043
this will have to do.

01:42:13.089 --> 01:42:14.292

Nor I.

01:43:07.075 --> 01:43:08.005
Maybe...

01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:12.449
maybe we'll
understand all this later.

01:43:16.953 --> 01:43:18.049
Maybe.

01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:19.115
Hmm.

Thanks for getting
me the hell out of that.

01:44:54.252 --> 01:44:55.653
What would I do without you?

01:44:55.955 --> 01:44:57.654
Easy. You'd live.

01:44:58.123 --> 01:44:59.491
Like I would without you.

What do you mean?

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:02.792
We don't have
a lot of time, Mike.
