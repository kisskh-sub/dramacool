00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.470
Did you bring

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.910
what I asked for?

Jiang Yi?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.240
Where is he?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.690
We didn't find him.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.310
I saw him just yesterday,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.310
but today he suddenly disappeared.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.829
Xiao Beiming.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.560
He shouldn't have gone far.

Fang Yin,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.250
go ask around the unit

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.440
and find out which brother

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.190
last saw him.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.740
Okay.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.990
Tong Shuang,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.080
take some people

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.640
to each city gate

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.900
and ask the gate guards

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.360
if they've seen him leave the city.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.030
If not,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.030
station someone there to keep watch.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.630
Okay.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.280
Xueman,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.310
go check his home.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.750
Chief Fang,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.310
send all our men out

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.710
to search the entire city,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.040
but don't alert anyone.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.480

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.280
The last sighting of Constable Jiang

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.430
was this morning.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.310
I asked

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.280
all the gate guards,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.840
and none

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.030
saw him leave the city.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.870
It hasn't even been a day.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.080
He should still be in the city.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.560
Fang Yin has been taking people

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.000
to search every street and alley.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.329
Let's wait a bit longer.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.240
There's no sign
of cooking at Jiang Yi's place.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.630
Looks like

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.190
he hasn't been back for days.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.430
I also found
a Chronicle of Pacifying Pirates in the Eastern Sea

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.040
under his desk.

[Chronicle of Pacifying Pirates
in the Eastern Sea]

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.270
I remember

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.120
he's a filial son.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240
Three years ago,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.120
his mother fell seriously ill.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.720
Back then, King Zhong of Constables

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.040
asked all the men in the unit

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.790
to chip in for her treatment.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.270
I heard that all these years,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.120
he's always kept his mother by his side

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.720
to care for her.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.120
Even if Constable Jiang

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.430
hid himself,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.140
there's no way

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.250
he'd take his elderly mother

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.360
with him.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.830
There was no sign of cooking at his home.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.190
His mother is old, sick,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.430
and has trouble moving.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.800
Lately,
there has been no one at his place,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.600
and there's no sign he's left the city.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.130
Could something have happened
to his family?

[Exactness]

Junior Xiao.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.270
I knew you'd find me.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.430
Since you appeared

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.480
and Chief Fang brought you back

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.280
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.830
I realized this

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.890
couldn't be kept secret anymore.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.240
I admit what I've done.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
Actually,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.600
I wasn't trying to hide from you.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.330
Why did you

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.060
leak the information to Yesha?

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.560
How could you do this

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.950
to the Elite Constabulary Unit?

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.810
How could you do this to my father?

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.510
If I hadn't been desperate,

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.900
I wouldn't have done it.

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:43.620
I'm guilty.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.950
Arrest me.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.070
What exactly happened?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.730
My mother was gravely ill.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.750
Treatment...

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.070
costs money.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.710
I used to work in the dovecote,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.060
so I know how to decode.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.420
So I started transcribing

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.540
to make a living.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.690
I knew it was wrong.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.560
That's why the books I sent out

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.320
never involved anyone's life—

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.980
just so

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.420
I could ease my conscience.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.980
Then why did you

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.460
cooperate with Huang Wuchang?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:11.830
He's a serious criminal.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.630
Yes,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.980
he is a serious criminal,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.100
but my mother's illness

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.390
kept getting worse—

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.340
she even started coughing up blood.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.100
She couldn't sleep at night

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.510
because of the pain.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.190
The doctor told me

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.040
the treatment
would cost 50 taels of silver.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.190
If she didn't get help soon,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.980
it would be too late.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.070
You know better than anyone

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.630
how little money

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.230
a constable like me can make.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:37.900
It was then

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.590
that Huang Wuchang's accomplices found me

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:41.150
and asked me to find out

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.710
his escort route.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.950
I was really out of options.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.950
For my mother,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.409
I decided to take the risk.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.680
Zhuge Tong tried to bribe me

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.340
to work for him
in the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.540
I played along,

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.230
pretending to defect to him,

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.300
tricked him into revealing information,

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.760
and figured out
which book was the codebook.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.340
Then I used bait
to lure the carrier pigeon

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:04.540
and stole the letter.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.950
Then I sold Huang Wuchang's escort route

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.540
to his accomplices.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.100
Maybe I deserved it.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:12.830
Although I got

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.070
the 50 taels,

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.030
I couldn't save my mother.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.540
As a constable,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.530
I broke the law knowingly.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:25.010
I deserve whatever punishment I get.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.540
How did you deal with

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.710
Huang Wuchang?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.110
Where was it?

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.429
What did the contact look like?

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.870
Are you looking for me?

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.900
You...

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.060
You're Yesha?

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.690
How would he come to see you in person?

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.770
You're not worthy yet.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.180
Did you bring

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.400
what I asked for?

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.780
This is the message route
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.820
I've already cracked

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.060
the code inside.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.930
That's how it happened.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.510
The person who contacted me

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.940
was one of his subordinates.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.060
He was wearing a face cloth,

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.350
with a deep scar

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.420
on his forehead.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.830
Also, he was wearing

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.780
a shell-shaped pendant

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.030
around his neck,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.270
which was quite distinctive

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.270
and rare to see

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.700
in the capital.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.110
That's all

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.870
I can tell you.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.230
Let's go,

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.540
Yi.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.900
Brothers of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.100
over the past few days,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.110
I've watched you

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.170
save Xueman at the execution ground,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.800
investigate the case,
and search for clues.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.900
Each of you

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.190
has been full of drive.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.060
And Beiming,

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.580
even though he was in prison

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.580
and shackled,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.900
he still looked like

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.630
my spirited junior he once was.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.350
It feels like all of you

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.270
have come back—

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.900
except for me,

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.270
Jiang Yi,

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.180
your senior brother...

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:56.470
I can't come back.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.230
How cruel fate is.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.540
Chief Fang,

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.700
I've failed you.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.600
I've failed my brothers.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.460
I'm so sorry.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.660
Zhong Xueman.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.060
Chief Fang,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.540
before I go, can I

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.510
kowtow to my mother one last time?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.860
Yi!

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.400
Yi!

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.100
Yi!

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.720
Yi!

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:48.870
Don't touch him!

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.060
-Yi!
-Yi!

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:57.750
Tweezers!

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.750
This... this is...

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:15.670
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.820
Both the Old Bug and Yi

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:23.700
had these crystal stones on their bodies.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.030
This is definitely no coincidence.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.390
Could there really be

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.110
a technique

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.660
that kills with lightning?

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.820
If such a technique exists,

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.940
who would be behind it?

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:34.990
Why did they kill

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.510
the Old Bug and Jiang Yi?

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.630
Could it be Yesha,

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.960
trying to silence them?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.660
Jiang Yi has seen

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.060
Huang Wuchang's subordinate,

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.700
so he might have been killed
for that reason.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.780
But the Old Bug...

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.510
Yesha needed him alive to make elixirs.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.710
Why would he kill him?

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.780
I thought of someone.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.200
He's a bronze beast craftsman.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.320
Maybe he knows

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.070
what these crystal stones are.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.650
What's a bronze beast craftsman?

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:06.900
Have you seen

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.700
the bronze beasts

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.110
on temple and palace eaves?

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.750
Do you know

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.580
what they're for?

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.350
I read in a book before

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.300
that the tongue of a bronze beast
is made of metal

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:16.560
to attract lightning.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.180
Inside, there's an iron pipe

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.510
that goes underground,

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.150
used to divert lightning
and prevent fires.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.730
See?

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.150
Miss Huo is really smart.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.990
As the name suggests,
bronze beast craftsmen

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.780
are artisans who make bronze beasts.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.990
They're most knowledgeable

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.940
about lightning.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.700
If you have questions
about lightning, ask them.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.420
Jiang Yi said

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.030
Huang Wuchang has an accomplice

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.270
who wears a black robe and a veil,

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.470
has a scar on his face,

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.900
and wears

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.470
a uniquely shaped shell pendant
around his neck.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.070
This should be a useful clue.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.300
I know a place we can go.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.380
I've already used that thing

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.510
to kill Jiang Yi.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.380
My Lord, I've completed

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.310
the task you assigned to me.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.580
You promised me

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.300
that once the task was done,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.700
you'd spare me

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.420
and let me live peacefully with my wife
and daughter in the mountains.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.780
But the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.240
are still investigating.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.270
If you go now

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.270
and get caught,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.580
how can I trust

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.630
you won't leak information?

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.760
Only the dead keep secrets.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:23.230
My Lord, spare me!

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.350
I won't say anything.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.860
For your loyalty,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.540
I won't kill you.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.680
You'd better be smart about this.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.270
Your wife and daughter's lives

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.540
are in your hands.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.110
Master's elixir

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.900
is about to be ready.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.750
We cannot fail this time.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.270
Otherwise,

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.460
none of us will survive.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.230
Yes.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.540
Come on.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.540
Who exactly are you

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540
taking us to see?

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.510
Why so mysterious?

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:55.700
This person is Mr. Jiao.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.900
He's a top expert
in casting bronze beasts.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.300
He can cast different bronze beasts

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.140
based on the building's height and shape,

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.300
as well as
the surrounding climate conditions.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.060
Buildings fitted with

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.390
his bronze beasts

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.530
have never been struck by lightning.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.390
Even the imperial palace

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.650
invited him to cast their bronze beasts.

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.060
That's impressive.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.900
Looks like we found the right person

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.940
this time.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.900
Tong Shuang,

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.180
you look worried.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.660
Getting help from Mr. Jiao

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.060
won't be easy, right?

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.450
You guessed it again.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.540
But at this point,

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.380
he's our only option.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.630
Let's go.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.180
I've finished

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.660
all my orders this month.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.180
I'm not taking any new orders.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:43.820
Mr. Jiao,

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.750
how have you been lately?

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.270
Oh, it's Constable Tong.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:48.750
Yes.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:50.750
I brought two friends with me today.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.660
We have something
we want you to take a look at.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.900
I'm surprised you came.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.750
What is it?

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:05.540
This.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.619
It's a rare thing.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:15.510
Mr. Jiao,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.910
just give us a straight answer.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.819
Do you

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.839
know this thing?

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.339
When you first got it,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.140
did you smell a sweet, sticky scent?

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.500
Mr. Jiao,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.530
it seems we've come to the right person.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.910
So what is this thing?

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.670
I can tell you

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.910
what it is,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.380
but

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.840
you have to help me with something.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.030
What is it?

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.640
Mr. Jiao, what happened to you?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.750
A month ago,

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.540
while working,

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.580
I accidentally fell from a roof.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.780
This iron needle pierced my skull.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.620
It didn't damage my brain,

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.910
so I miraculously survived.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.100
But the doctor said

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.060
it can't be pulled out

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.060
and that if it is, I'd certainly die.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:10.910
I'm carrying this thing

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.510
in my head.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.380
When it acts up,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.430
I get splitting headaches

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.100
and have to
drink a lot of pain-relief wine

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.820
to ease the pain.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.750
I've had enough.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.580
I'm sick of this torment.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.540
I've asked many doctors,

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.300
but none dared to remove it.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.580
Aren't you curious

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.100
what that thing is?

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.780
As long as you remove it for me,

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.990
I'll tell you everything.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.710
Other doctors didn't dare to pull it out.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.190
How could we?

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.540
Madman, you're a doctor.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.940
Talk some sense into him.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.540
You know medicine?

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.190
Can you help me?

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.510
The risk is quite significant.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.580
Then tell him

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.840
how confident you are.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.710
Less than 50%.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.860
Mr. Jiao,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.230
I think leaving this thing in your head

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.340
is the safest option.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.750
This thing isn't in your head!

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.850
Mr. Jiao, please clam down.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.060
I can help you remove it.

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.620
Madman,

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.750
if you don't do it right,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.080
we'll be the murderers.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.040
Just go ahead and do it.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.170
I won't hold you responsible.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.750
I can write a will

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:18.570
to guarantee your innocence.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.620
Aren't you curious

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.750
what this thing is?

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:22.190
You want my help,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.470
so first you must help me with this.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:25.670
Mr. Jiao,

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:26.620
I'm doing this

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.540
not just for your help,

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.270
but out of a doctor's compassion.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.580
We can't just stand by
and watch a patient suffer—

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.950
that's our responsibility.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.910
Besides, with this in your head,

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.570
you don't have much time left.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.230
This is very dangerous.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.230
I need an answer from you:

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.520
shall I pull it out?

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.780
Yes!

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.670
Once I remove the iron piece

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.950
and insert the acupuncture needles,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.540
you must immediately apply medicine
to stop the bleeding.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.380
No delay.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.100
Okay.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.380
Mr. Jiao,

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.710
think about

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:06.990
any regrets you have.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.780
Here's a tip:

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.100
when you feel like you can't hold on,

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.620
think of your regrets

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.860
and you'll find the strength to survive.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.030
I want

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.340
to go to the Zhengde Gate tower
to get some fresh air

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.270
because there's

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.380
a bronze beast there I made.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:26.620
It's the best one

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.780
I've cast in years.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:37.820
Constable Zhong.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.380
Please take a look.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.580
Speaking of shell products,

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.580
you've certainly come to the right person.

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.140
Throughout the entire capital,

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:49.670
only our shop

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:50.620
has these.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.710
Manager Jin, are you so sure?

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:53.910
Of course.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.750
You might not know,

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.030
but wearing shell-shaped jewelry

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.620
is a custom from the East Sea region,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:03.230
symbolizing good luck and safety.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.140
However, only craftsmen from Penglai

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.230
know the art

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.340
of processing shells.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.300
In the entire capital,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.750
only our shop

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.950
has such

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.450
a craftsman from Penglai.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.930
Then please call him over.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:18.910
I have some questions for him.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.170
Of course, no problem.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.140
Please make yourself comfortable.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.910
Servants.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:28.780
Mr. Jiao,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.780
I've written down

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:30.990
the prescription and dosage

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.380
for this medicine.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.190
You'll recover in half a month.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:35.160
In six months,

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:36.980
you'll be as good as anyone else.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.190
Then I'll tell you

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.190
what you

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.190
want to know.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.190
As bronze beast craftsmen, we all know

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.860
there's a strange mountain

00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.990
east of the capital.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.640
It gets struck by lightning
whenever it's cloudy or rainy.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.430
Over time,

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.750
we called it Mount Lightning.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.510
I'm very curious about Mount Lightning

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.380
and often investigate it.

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.860
Later,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.430
I found in an ancient book

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.380
a legend about a mysterious substance

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.140
that attracts lightning

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.670
when the weather is overcast and rainy.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.380
And this substance

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:27.580
comes from Mount Lightning.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.670
This legendary substance

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.030
is called thunder gold.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.140
Although it's metal,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.670
it's like grease.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.820
It usually looks

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.060
no different from mercury.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.030
But once it enters humans or animals,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.270
it attracts lightning

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.290
during overcast, rainy weather.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.060
After thunder gold is struck by lightning,

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.340
it produces

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.750
colorful crystals like the one

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.510
you just showed me,

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.670
which appear from the bodies of humans

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:57.760
or animals

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.990
and are accompanied by a sweet,
syrupy fragrance.

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:02.910
It's incredible

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.040
that such a magical substance exists.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.300
Since thunder gold is so rare,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.140
have you seen

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.430
anyone else use it?

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.510
The hunter from the mountain produce shop

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.140
asked me to craft a bronze beast

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.030
for him a month ago.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.100
I happened

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.620
to find out he uses thunder gold
for hunting.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.520
I never expected the legendary substance

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.820
to exist in reality.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.270
Out of curiosity,

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.510
I asked him a few questions.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.190
A month ago?

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.160
Could that be when you got injured?

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.950
The next day, while working,

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:41.950
I fell from the rooftop.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.010
I'm afraid this wasn't an accident.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.430
Someone must have wanted to kill you.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.060
Kill me?

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:53.860
That hunter?

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.620
He seems very happy

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.780
with his wife and kid.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.950
They are a happy family.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:01.190
Why do you think

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.190
he would want to kill me?

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.580
You may know someone's face,
but not their heart.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.620
Since thunder gold
can be used for hunting,

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.030
it can also be used to kill.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.300
Besides, you saw him

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.230
using thunder gold while hunting.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:16.950
Please take good care of yourself.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.230
We'll go find him now.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.470
Wait.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.270
Remember,

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.340
if thunder gold enters your body,

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.620
do not go out on cloudy or rainy days.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.140
Stay in a sealed room

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.950
for 24 hours

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.470
and only leave once the thunder gold

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.710
has dissipated.

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.840
Thank you, Mr. Jiao.

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:41.910
Scarface?

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:42.670
Yes.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.100
He was wearing a face veil,

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:44.780
with a deep scar

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.140
on his forehead.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:47.710
I don't know him personally,

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.510
but from their accent,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:50.670
he and his wife

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.030
are likely from my hometown.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.710
His wife specially asked me

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.750
to make that shell ornament

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.190
you mentioned.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.850
Do you know where he lives now?

00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.620
I don't.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.990
But judging by their clothes,

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:03.100
they seem to be hunters from the mountain.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.910
Hunters?

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:04.470

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.960
won't find him.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.540
Here's the plan:

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.710
I'll keep watch here.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.750
You go get the brothers

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:47.140
from the Elite Constabulary Unit

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.470
to search the mountain.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.670
Don't worry, he's not skilled in combat.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:51.930
I can handle him alone.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.580
Be careful.

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.070
Young Master.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.830
Young Master,

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.600
Miss Huo just told me

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.290
Huang Wuchang might be hiding
on Mount Lightning.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:36.030
The Elite Constabulary Unit

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.630
is gathering forces
to surround the mountain.

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.300
Mount Lightning?

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.580
Could this information be a trap?

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.440
Definitely not.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.230
Why would they be so kind

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.710
as to share such important info

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:52.540
with us?

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.420
One good turn deserves another.

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.380
Right now, they are repaying us, I think.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.710
So what should we do now?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.930
Let me out immediately.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:01.470
I need to report this to Chief.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.030
But His Majesty's ordered that...

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.170
Who cares about the imperial order now?

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:04.860
If we delay any longer,

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:05.670
it'll be too late.

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.270
Hurry up.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.310
Unlock it.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:18.750
Chief, I've brought him here.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.780
Still no sign of Tong Shuang?

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.710
A thick fog suddenly came up
on the mountain.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.470
We've already sent several groups of men.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.730
No one's come down yet—

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.060
not even Tong Shuang.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.310
Does this mountain swallow people?

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:31.620
Uncle,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.670
why don't we

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.880
wait for reinforcements now?

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.990
Once the City Guard arrives

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:35.860
and surrounds the mountain,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.060
I'm sure they'll come down.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:37.950
Chief Fang,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.640
Tong Shuang is still on the mountain.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.620
The situation is critical.

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.860
We're running out of time.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.780
Chief Fang,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.130
let me go up to find him.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:45.570
I'm willing to go too.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.710
Me too.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.020
I—I'll go too.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.060
-Me too.
-Me too.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:49.820
Me too!

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:50.410
I'll go too!

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.180
Me too!

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.860
Chief Fang.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.480
Remember,

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.380
you must come back alive.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.240
Let's go.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.960
The fog is thick here.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.910
Be careful.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.910
Gather around me.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:26.480
Okay.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.910
Tong Shuang should be just ahead.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.110
Let's keep moving up.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.700
Watch your step.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:06.580
Be careful.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.430
Is it taken care of?

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:42.580
Yes.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.730
This idiot.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.860
He was injured

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.460
and still dared to come here,

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.030
blindly bringing the constables.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.300
He's more trouble than help.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:58.910
Everyone,

00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.620
why do I feel like

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.580
we've just been through

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.710
this place already?

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.130
Look!

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.410
Could there really be a ghost wall?

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:09.340
Don't be afraid.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.480
We've reached the place.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.030
What place?

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.320
Inside the formation.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.590
The reason we got lost is that

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.540
there's a formation

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.620
on Mount Lightning.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.330
A formation?

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.930
Do such things really exist?

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.430
They do.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.340
Legend has it that a General
from the previous dynasty

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.340
used the terrain as a formation

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.430
to trap thousands of enemy troops there

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:27.030
for 10 days and nights.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.230
The formation

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.030
is just using

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.270
the thick mountain fog

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.230
and surroundings

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.270
to deceive people.

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:33.750
So you've already...

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.580
Everyone, stick close to me.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.190
Let's go.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.300
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.100
Take this.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:10.790
What is this?

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:12.469
You don't need to know.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.870
You guys again?

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.870
Attack!

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:42.739
Attack!

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.350
Let's go!

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.390
I forgot

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.700
you've regained your martial skills.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.430
Now it's my turn to protect you.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:23.930
Kill them all!

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.240
Leave no one alive!

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:37.270

Let's go.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.990
Hurry!

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.490
Hurry!

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:19.440
Take everyone away!

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.870
Are you alright?

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.660
I'm fine.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.520
It's not like this is my first time.

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:29.700
You know

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.120
you can't do anything to me.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.380
Once you're in
the Elite Constabulary Unit's prison,

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.170
you'll see.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:35.740
It's not like
you haven't been there before.

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:37.180
I know you're not Yesha.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.790
Who is the real Yesha?

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:39.510
Where is he?

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.100
Tell me,

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.880
and I'll guarantee your life.

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.910
Didn't you track him to Haiya?

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.790
Master is in Haiya.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.260
If you've got the guts,

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:53.350
go to Haiya

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.580
and find him.

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.580
What's your name?

00:38:59.360 --> 00:38:59.870
My...

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.700
My name is Huang Liang.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.030
Follow me from now on.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.090
No one will bully you anymore.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.950
Master,

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.710
what should I do?

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.430
Revenge.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.540
Run!

00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:21.430
Run!
