Aren't I brilliant?

Yes!

Don't be surprised, Shen Wangchen.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.200
I always saw the old fox and his wife

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.400
doing that.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.840
You'll get used to it after this.

Everyone.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.120
Starting today,

Master.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.599
Hurry, see if there's anything wrong
with the Demonic Spirit Formation!

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.240
Master.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.719
This formation gathers
only the aura of subdued spirits.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.560
There's nothing unusual.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.560
She's come alive.

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:31.560
That's impossible.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.240
Who's it?

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:37.080
A hundred years ago,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.360
our sect had a fierce fight
with the Cat Demon.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.360
In the end, she was slain.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.599
She then destroyed her demon core,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.000
turning to ashes.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.159
You mean,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.479
this bamboo tube has stayed dark
for a century,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.319
but today...

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.599
As long as her demon core remains,
its aura is unscattered.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.879
A faint glow has appeared.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.080
That demon is nothing but vile.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.560
No matter what, she must be eradicated.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.680
Yes, Master.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:52.600
What did I dream about?

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.639
Why do I feel ashamed?

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.279
No,

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.000
I feel embarrassed.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.639
No...

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.199
What is this feeling?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040
Stop thinking about it.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.279
Don't fall for his temptation.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.480
I'm a chief after all.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.079
(That dream...)

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.480
Well,

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.319
does it look good on me?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.480
Yes, it does.

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:42.800
(Why did it feel so real?)

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.240
Dayao.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.959
Dayao.

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.199
Dayao.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.279
Your Majesty.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.399
Just what do you suffer from?

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:21.360
Ever since the dream about that mortal,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.319
I've been hearing things

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:24.959
and my body can't stop burning.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.680
Do you mean Mr. Shen?

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.240
Your Majesty.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.040
Look.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.480
Did your dream

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.519
look like this?

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.199
That's right.

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.560
It looked exactly

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.439
like this.

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:44.560
Your Majesty.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.199
Well,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.399
that's not an ailment.

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.439
It's considered

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.800
a spell.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.600
It's named Flirty Spell.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.600
Flirty Spell?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.720
Shen Wangchen.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.720
You despicable man.

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.839
Perfect timing.

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:32.600
What... What are you laughing about?

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:37.879
You look

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:39.720
quite different today.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.240
Speak.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240
What evil spell did you use

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.480
to get into my dream?

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.160
You promised to stand by me
through weal and woe.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.399
Yet you stoop so low behind my back!

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:51.920
You dreamed of me?

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:54.240
That's right.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:56.399
What did you dream of?

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:02.000
Well...

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.720
Outrageous!

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.079
Trying to pry into my dream, huh?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.519
Listen here, Shen Wangchen.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:11.279
Don't think you can control me.

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:13.439
Withdraw that wicked spell at once

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.399
or don't blame me

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:16.360
for disregarding our bond.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:19.199
Our bond?

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.120
What are you doing?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.680
You... You know perfectly well

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.079
what I'm talking about.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.199
