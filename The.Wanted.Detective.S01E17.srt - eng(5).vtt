Since the fire burned it down,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.160
no one has lived here.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.400
But I think it could be habitable
with some cleaning.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.470
Definitely habitable.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.360
This is much safer than an inn.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.240
Let's go inside and have a look.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.840
Okay.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.490
Are you okay?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.150
I'm okay.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.410
I just didn't rest well on the journey.

Mr. Hai, it's a long story.

These are my friends,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240

Where have you been all these years?

You must have suffered a lot.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.070
If Master knew you were still alive,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.270

even from beyond the grave.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.120
When the tragedy took place here
at the agency,

I happened to be back in my hometown.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.690
I never expected that when I returned...

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.159
Almost 100 people in the entire agency

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.550
were all gone in just one night.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.830
The Tong family showed me
great kindness,

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.560
especially Old Master Tong, who treated me

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.600
like his own family.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.480

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.000
Why wasn't I here when that happened?

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.600
All these years, I've been heartbroken.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.600
I would rather have been burnt

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.770

Back then, I raised money everywhere,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.830
buried Master, Madam,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.120
and everyone else,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.390
and then returned to my hometown
to take care of my parents.

My parents passed away
a few years ago,

I'll go make some food for you.

keep watching me all the time.

Okay.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.070
Put it in the room
in the East Courtyard then.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.750
If you have grievances
or crimes to report,

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.890
come find me at Weizhou Garrison.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:49.270
However,

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.030
from today on,
if anyone causes trouble in groups again

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.230
and gets caught by me,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.770
I will show no mercy!

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.070
Disperse!

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:57.400
Let's go.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.510
Everyone, disperse.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.170
Move along.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.600
Move along. Move along.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.150
Young Master, please calm down.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.510
These are just foolish actions
by ignorant people.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.230
No need to bother with them.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.750
When my dad was still alive,

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.810
he did so many good deeds for Weizhou,

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.770
yet now,
his reputation can't even withstand

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.110
a few rumors!

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.930
There's no smoke without fire.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.200
This all started because of

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.480
the escort wagons
of the Pingyuan Escort Agency.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:28.200
Mr. Hai.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.510
I'd like to ask,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.230
shouldn't these escort flags and wagons

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:32.830
belong to the escort agency?

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.960
After the escort agency was wiped out,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.000
all the escort equipment and items

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.830
were completely looted.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.790
Who knows

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.740
whose hands they've fallen into?

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.920
It's all ancient history now.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.270
So you're saying

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.350
anyone could use

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.810
this haunted escort wagon

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.200
to create an illusion.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.160
Our Weizhou Garrison failed in our duty.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.270
Sorry to have embarrassed ourselves
in front of you, My Lord.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.070
No need to worry about it.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.790
I should thank you

00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.880
for getting us out of that situation
today, Constable Wang.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.160
Don't mention it. You're too kind.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.270
Constable Wang,

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.350
could we take over

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.350
this escort wagon case?

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.110
That would be better, of course.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.030
I can fully cooperate with you.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.110
In that case,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.140
there's a personal matter
I’d like to ask about.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.140
[Post Station]

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.820
[Weizhou Post Station]

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.400
These horses look

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.720
so listless.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.890
They must be quite sick indeed.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.720
Is there something wrong with the feed?

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.030
I don't see any issues.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.400
These horses were all eating

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.730
quite happily just now.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.480
Look!

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.710
Why is the horse acting like this again?

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.790
Watch out!

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.590
Hurry!

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.170
Chase after it!

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.110
What's going on?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.110
I'm terribly sorry.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.310
Hope the horse didn't give you a fright.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.350
The horse was still fine

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.510
when it was grazing earlier.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.550
During my shifts,

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.480
the horses have only been startled twice,

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.680
but after each time,

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.110
they've become listless.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.310
The doctors from the veterinary clinic

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.350
have prescribed medicine,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.810
but the horses' condition

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.290
just isn't improving.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.000
In fact,

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.630
it seems to be getting worse.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.880
Horses only eat grass and drink water.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.560
Since the fodder is fine,

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:27.640
the problem must be with the water.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.590
Where do you usually

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.960
get water for the horses?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.920
I fetched this bucket of water

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.450
from a river on the west side

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.670
of the stables today.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.440
Today?

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.510
Do you normally fetch it
from somewhere else?

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.550
Sometimes when we're feeling lazy,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.270
we don't go all the way to the river.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.030
We just

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.130
fetch it from the well in the stables.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.480
Why go so far when there's water nearby?

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.200
Well,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.200
it's a new rule from the higher-ups.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.060
That river is called Salty River.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.240
The water flows down

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.480
from those mountains over there.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.400
Since the river water is slightly salty,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
the locals

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.070
don't like to drink from it,

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.960
so it's used for
watering the animals instead,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.070
which works out perfectly.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.680
And the water from the stable well

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.750
is pure,

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:03.960
so it's designated

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.600
for human consumption only.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.880
I see.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.790
This also explains

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.400
why these horses

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.640
don't get spooked

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.240
every time they drink water.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.480
The problem must be with that river.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.000
Red Obsidian?

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.440
Constable Zhong, you like this stone?

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.200
But it's such a pity.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.200
Had I known you liked it,

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.070
I would have collected some for you.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.190
But now in Weizhou,

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.920
this stone can no longer be found.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.160
Is this red obsidian

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.750
so rare and precious?

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.790
Rare it certainly is,

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.760
but not particularly valuable.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.960
You see,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.310
the red obsidian

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.310
comes from Mount Chixia.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.600
This kind of red stone

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.960
can't be made into jewelry,

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.620
nor can it be smelted for iron,

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.070
and its yield is low.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.920
So naturally, no one cares about it,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.000
let alone trades it.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.260
But if that's the case,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.830
why did you say

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.510
this stone can no longer be found?

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.550
About a year ago,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.650
a wealthy merchant came to Weizhou

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.830
and bought all the quarries

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.750
at Mount Chixia.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.210
Not only did he mine it all,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:03.680
but he also aggressively bought up

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.640
all the red obsidian from the locals.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.030
When someone's willing to pay,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:08.240
people naturally sell.

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.440
Who is this merchant?

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.790
Is he still in Weizhou?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.550
That I don't know.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.550
If you want to look for him,

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.960
I can have someone look into it for you.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.770
Thank you, Constable Wang.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.270
If you get any news about this person,

00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:21.750
please let me know immediately.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.440
No problem.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:25.040
A mysterious merchant
who buys red obsidian?

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.370
This merchant is really strange.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.350
He must be Yesha, right?

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.400
Hard to say.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.090
About the sick horses,

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.160
Coroner Feng and Dairong
have gone to investigate.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:36.200
Right now, we should focus on

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200
the escort agency's problem

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.440
and figure out what's going on

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.400
with the haunted escort wagon.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.200
That's right.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920
Beiming, tell us,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.480
what's our next step?

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:45.720
The troublemakers said

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.830
that recently, many families'

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.920
buried corpses

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.030
have disappeared along with

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.030
the haunted escort wagon.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:51.440
Can we really trust

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.720
what those bastards say?

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.920
Whether we believe it or not,
we need to investigate.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.350
First, let's look into

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.680
the recent cases:

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:56.850
when they happened,

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.080
where they occurred,

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.590
and if there were any witnesses.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.250
The more details, the better.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.880
Here, careful.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.720
I've looked into the corpse theft cases

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.780
from the past year.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.310
Starting last year, every month,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.040
at this suburban burial ground,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.480
[Weizhou]

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.000
numerous corpses have been stolen.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.510
And also since last year,

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:01.640
people have been

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.160
spotting haunted escort wagons
every month.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.880
The haunted escort wagons
and the corpse thefts

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.680
started almost simultaneously.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.720
So that means

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.400
the haunted escort wagon is very likely

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.160
appearing specifically
for corpse stealing.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.510
I wonder what they did

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.560
with all those stolen corpses.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:16.400
I'm back.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:18.270
Where is Miss Huo?

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.530
She's not feeling well

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:20.680
and went to rest.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.180
She's feeling unwell?

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.880
You're about to

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.140
feel unwell yourselves too, I'm afraid.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.200
Is this a human finger?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:36.750
Yes.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.000
Just burned to a crisp.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.400
Where did you find it?

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.000
Upstream of the Salty River.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.830
And

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.080
I also found something else.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.790
Someone was burning corpses by the river?

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.960
To be precise,
they were processing corpses.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.880
Those kilns were built
right along the river.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.750
The kiln waste is

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.270
dumped directly into the water.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:14.270
It's these things

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.920
that contaminated the water source.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.030
The horses at the downstream stables

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.030
drank that water

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.030
and got horse plague.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.510
Fortunately, the villagers nearby

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:21.440
have never drunk

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.350
water from that river.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.350
Otherwise, it would have caused

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.410
even greater harm.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.170
Unfortunately,

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.440
the corpse processors noticed

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.920
our movements and those of
the Weizhou Garrison,

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.830
so they abandoned the kilns and fled.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:31.960
These burned corpses

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:32.750
are very likely

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.550
the corpses stolen

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.210
by the haunted escort wagons.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.350
Those people were burning corpses to...

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.480
Extract corpse oil.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:39.590
Old Bug once mentioned that

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.920
they use corpse oil to refine red crystal.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:43.830
In that case, the haunted escort wagon

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.240
is also connected to Yesha?

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.720
They abandoned the kilns and fled,

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:47.960
but the corpses haven't been fully burned.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.750
They'll likely use

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.960
the haunted escort wagons
to steal more corpses.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.270
Has anyone been buried recently?

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.920
Yes,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.750
but...

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.120
There are two people.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.040
One of them

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.870
was a wealthy merchant from town

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.200
who just died from illness.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:03.680
The other

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.010
was a farmer from nearby

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.240
who fell into a ditch,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.640
hit his head on a rock,

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.350
and died from the impact.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.480
A wealthy family's corpse
would be difficult to steal.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.000
They'll probably

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.460
go with the farmer's body.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.760
Coroner Feng.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.070
Stay here and look after Miss Huo.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.960
What about you?

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.970
We'll go confront
that haunted escort wagon.

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:39.590
Beiming, what about your cold?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.680
It's nothing.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.270
Where are the people sent by
the Weizhou Garrison?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.590
Too many people would make us too visible,

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:44.920
which might alert the culprit.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.450
They're all hiding nearby.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.090
Tong Shuang, where is that new grave?

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:53.800
See that tombstone over there?

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.160
I placed two joss papers under the grave.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.070
Tonight, we'll definitely

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.670
catch whoever is behind
these ghostly tricks.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.340

They

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.030
are the real "spirits" driving the wagons.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.310
The so-called haunted escort wagon

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.840
is nothing but a deception.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:39.320
It's a sulfur-core candle.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.270
Sulfur-core candle?

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.160
What's that?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.680
When copper powder is mixed into the wick,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.310
it produces a green flame,

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:49.950
just like fireworks.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.510
With these green candles

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.350
on the wagon

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:53.680
and a stove like this,

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:55.790
burning dried camphor

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:56.750
and cypress wood inside,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.280
they can create white smoke

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.180
that obscures our vision.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.720
I see.

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.310
But how do

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.170
the wagons move by themselves?

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.010
They hide in the shadows

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.350
and use these black iron wires

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.310
to pull the wagons
and control their direction,

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.960
creating

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.750
the illusion that
the wagons move on their own.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.880
With these candles and smoke,

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.240
ordinary people

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.750
would naturally think they've seen ghosts.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.270
But once the candles are extinguished,

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:23.030
they can't find

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.760
the wagons in the smoke either.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.790
Am I right?

In our line of work,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.310
we need to divert attention.

to our advantage.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.000

abandoned escort wagons.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:08.830
We modified them a bit,

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.240
and then we started operating under

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.920
the name of the haunted escort wagon

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.030
to transport corpses.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.110

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.860
what the corpses are used for?

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.880
selling corpses for some money.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.940
We truly don't know

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.160
what they were used for.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.590
We have no idea

who it was.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.880

upstream of the Salty River

It's a good plan,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.070
Tong Shuang listens to you the most.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:31.270
Please talk to him when you get a chance.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.810
I'll speak with him.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.970
How's your discussion going?

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.550
We've got the bait ready,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.510
just waiting to catch the big fish.

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.640
This time, let's not involve

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.880
the Weizhou Garrison.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.350
Just us few will be enough.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.480
This plan is extremely dangerous.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.540
Everyone must proceed with caution.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.160
Tong Shuang, go to the marketplace

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.720
disguised as a chamber pot vendor.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.920
Set up the contact signals

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.960
and observe secretly.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.200
Remember, don't act rashly.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.160
We don't know

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.510
who those people are, either.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:11.640
We just agreed

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.200
that whenever we have goods,

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.270
we'd go to the marketplace,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:16.270
set up grass markers,
and pretend to sell chamber pots.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.110
The number of chamber pots
indicates the number of items.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:20.110
At night,

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.310
we'd transport the corpses

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:22.830
to a small ditch outside the city.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:23.880
The buyers

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.920
would definitely show up for the exchange,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.440
and we'd do the money-for-goods swap.

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.880
Feng Qingzhuo.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.830
You'll be disguised as a corpse thief
making the delivery,

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.830
while Tong Shuang hides inside the coffin,

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:34.680
waiting for the right moment to strike.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.340
We'll catch them by surprise.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.750
Brute.

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.000
Later, I'll knock on the coffin
three times,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.830
and when they open it,

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.640
we'll catch them completely off guard.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.880
Got it. Got it.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.830
Stick to the plan.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.830
I know.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:03.920
Who are you?

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.270
Why don't I know your face?

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:08.480
We take turns making deliveries.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.000
It's none of your business who I am.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.630
Just give me the money

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.920
and check the goods.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.710
Fine, as long as you've got the goods.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.920
Why did you come out already?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.230
Stay back!

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.070
Or I'll kill your accomplice!

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.880
Let him go,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.420
or I'll kill him right now!

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.280
Go ahead and kill me if you dare.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.480
We've long been prepared

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.360
to sacrifice ourselves for Holy Master.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.159
That's right!

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.639
Go ahead and kill us.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.400
Madman, are you okay?

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.360
Tong Shuang.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.310
Why didn't you stick to the plan?

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.030
Do you realize

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.490
you almost got him killed?

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.110
Madman, I'm sorry.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.310
I was really worried they would escape.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.530
-Beiming...
-Miss Huo, I'll leave him to you.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.840
Madman, I'm really sorry.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.230
I'll go help them

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.150
and be right back.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:59.080
Wait for me here.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.760
Bear with it.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.480
It's alright.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.900
Who are you people?

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.360
Speak up! She's asking who you are!

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.280
With the descent of the Yellow Heaven,

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.630
we shall ascend.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.630
The demonic flames are purified,

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.110
and salvation spreads across the land.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.230
With the descent of the Yellow Heaven...

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.880
Stop chanting.

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.630
We shall ascend!

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:26.150
Stop it.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.840
The demonic flames are purified...

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.280
I said stop!

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.280
Salvation spreads across the land!

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.030
With the descent of the Yellow Heaven,

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:31.230
we shall ascend!

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.440
Tong Shuang!

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:37.400
Tong Shuang!

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.960
Are you trying to beat them to death?

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.190
You're a constable.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.280
Get out.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.480
Beiming...

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:49.280
Step outside.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.820
Calm yourself down.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.300
What is the Yellow Heaven?

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.070
It's a deity, of course.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.070
You've blasphemed against the deity,

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.130
and you'll surely face retribution!

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.880
Another Blossom Skies cult.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.550
Xueman.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.190
What is this thing?

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.070
This is an impurity pill made from

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.590
diseased chickens, ducks, geese,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.120
pigs, dogs, cats, and rats.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.070
Legend says that these seven

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.800
impure creatures combined together

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.960
can corrupt even the most powerful

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.360
spiritual practitioners.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.070
Tell me,

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.550
if they eat this,

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.880
will they still be able to ascend?

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.670
Will the Yellow Heaven still protect them?

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.320
You... You...

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.920
Stop trying to scare us.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.000
This isn't poison?

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.030
Not poison at all.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.670
Then let's try it on them.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.130
It won't kill them anyway.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:06.360
I'm telling you,

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.480
even if you kill me,

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.760
I won't talk!

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.840
I won't eat this!

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.840
I won't eat it!

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.560
I'll talk! I'll talk!

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:21.670
What do you want to know?

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.130
I'll tell you everything!

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:29.880
What is the Yellow Heaven?

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.760
Were you responsible for
the charred corpses

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.360
upstream of the Salty River?

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.670
Well...

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.330
I don't know about that.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.440
He doesn't know.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.280
Yes, yes!

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:44.920
It was us who did it.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.360
Why did you burn the corpses?

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:49.800
To extract corpse oil.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.260
What's the corpse oil for?

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:52.480
To make pills.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:54.880
Holy Master asked us to help

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:56.070
with the alchemy.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.000
What Holy Master? What alchemy?

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.110
Tell us everything you know.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.230
We don't know much about that, either.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.320
Holy Master is our leader.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.000
He ordered us to find corpses

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.190
to extract corpse oil.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.960
He said this would help create

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.800
the miraculous pills of immortality.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.070
Then all us disciples

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.440
will take them together,

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:21.170
so that we can achieve enlightenment
and ascend.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.630
I really don't know about

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:23.630
anything else, I swear.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.630
Still not being honest.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.760
Think harder.

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.960
H-He's telling the truth!

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:33.160
The alchemy is divided into Heaven's Roar
and Earth's Whisper.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.550
We are the ones

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.030
who use corpses for Earth's Whisper.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.480
Yes.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.940
What are Heaven's Roar
and Earth's Whisper?

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:43.710
Give him the pill.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.240
Earth's Whisper is about
extracting corpse oil.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.440
Yes. Right.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.680
Heaven's Roar is about
harvesting blood from the living.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.710
Have any of you seen Holy Master before?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.880
No.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.920
I-I've seen him once.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.780
He has seen him.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:10.970
He has.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.550
He has.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.920
He had his face covered then,

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:15.450
so I couldn't see clearly
what he looked like.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.560
Even with his face covered,

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:19.630
there must have been some exposed skin.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.360
Any distinguishing features?

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.960
I think there was a black mole by his eye.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.200
On the right side

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.030
of his eye, there's a black mole.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.800
Where do the Heaven's Roar people

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.460
get blood from living people?

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:36.230
We truly don't know about that.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.500
The Yellow Heaven has strict hierarchies.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.160
We Earth's Whisper disciples

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.800
are of the lowest rank.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.230
We don't even know

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:44.670
what the Heaven's Roar disciples
look like.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.670
We've told you

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:47.400
everything we know!
